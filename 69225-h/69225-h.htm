Bedtime Stories</h1>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day1">JANUARY 1: A New Year’s Party</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“Just because it was the first day of the year,” commenced daddy,
“and because parties were about the nicest things in the world
to the mind of a little girl named Ella, her mother decided to
give her one.</p>

<p>“‘It certainly does seem like the first of the year, or the first of
something,’ said Ella. ‘It’s a new day, a new year and we have new
toys and new games. We are even going to have supper out of new
dishes.’</p>

<p>“For among the presents Santa Claus had brought to Ella was a
fine set of dishes. They were pink and white and there were six cups
and saucers, six little plates, a teapot, sugar bowl and cream jug. It
was really a very complete set.</p>

<p>“They had thin bread and butter, hot chocolate with whipped cream
and a cake which Ella’s mother called a New Year’s cake. It was pink
and white on the top with pink sugared trimmings on the white frosting.</p>

<p>“In the center of the cake was one pink candle, for Ella’s mother said
it would be quite impossible to have a candle for the number of years
there had been, and too, it would be nice to have a new way and just
consider the year a day old.</p>

<p>“After the cake had been almost entirely eaten they played house.
Each little girl took a corner of the room as her house and fixed it up
with some of Ella’s things. They all had their own dolls and many
of their other toys so they really felt quite at home.</p>

<p>“Then they began calling on each other, dressing up in shawls and
old hats which Ella’s mother let them use. After a while they heard a
flutter, flutter against the window pane, and then another little flapping
sound.</p>

<p>“‘It’s a little bird,’ said Ella, as she looked out of the window.
‘It’s right on the sill, and I am dreadfully afraid it has hurt its wings.
Poor little dear.’</p>

<p>“They opened the window and Ella took the little bird in her hands.
Oh, how cold the little bird’s feathers were!</p>

<p>“‘We’ll take care of you,’ said Ella. They gave the little bird
some bread-crumbs and some water. Then he had a delicious piece
of lettuce from the seeds which Ella had started in a box in her room.</p>

<p>“Pretty soon the bird began to grow much better and hopped and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
chirped about the room, and then they let him out for he had simply
been very hungry.</p>

<p>“‘We’ll put some suet in that tree over there,’ said Ella.</p>

<p>“‘Let’s put some bread-crumbs,’ said her friends, and then one of
them added,</p>

<p>“‘And let’s give some of the New Year cake crumbs too.’</p>

<p>“So the little bird was given a regular New Year’s feast, and Ella
and her friends were among other children who decided to look after
the feathered people through the cold months of the winter and to give
them bread-crumbs and suet which they love so well.”</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day2">JANUARY 2: The Rhyming Years</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“Well,” said the Old Year, “I am going to make up a poem
about myself. I feel quite poetical.”</p>

<p>“And,” said the New Year, “I will, too.” For the New
Year didn’t want to have the Old Year think that he was unable to do
anything like that, even though he was young. But he felt very much
pleased when the Old Year said: “Though I have lived twelve whole
months, I have not become a poet.”</p>

<p>“I think age should be given the right to speak first,” said the New
Year.</p>

<p>The Old Year shook his white hair and smiled so that the wrinkles
in his face all ran in together.</p>

<p>This is what he said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Yes, it is true I was feeling old,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yes, it is true I was also cold,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yes, it is true I heard them cheer,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Welcoming in the glad New Year.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then New Year recited this verse:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Of course, you see I was out for fun,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My life has only just begun,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They said ‘He is young and full of vim,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No one can help but welcome him.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“You mustn’t think I am conceited,” he added. “I say a lot to
make my rhyme come out right.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said the Old Year, “for I do too. Well. I will give
my second verse. Don’t believe it all, though!” Then the Old Year<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
took an old harp he had and he began to play and sing, and this was
what he sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“And Poor Old Year—he almost wept</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As he packed up his things and left.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But as he turned to say good-by,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Something in him made him cry:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Though my work is mostly done,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I, have, too, had lots of fun,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And ’ere I go upon my way,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This I certainly would say:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Happy New Year, big and small,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Happy New Year, short and tall,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Happy New Year, every one!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">May you all have lots of fun!’”</div>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day3">JANUARY 3: Naughty Wind</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“The Clothes-Pins on the line,” said daddy, “were having a
very jolly time.</p>

<p>“‘I’ll blow those clothes away,’ said the North Wind.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, no you won’t,’ said the Clothes-Pins in chorus.</p>

<p>“‘You are only little wooden things,’ said the Wind. ‘I am strong
and powerful and can do just exactly as I like.’</p>

<p>“Now the Fairies saw that the Clothes-Pins were doing their work
so well that they thought they would like to help them, so they all
perched on the line and began to sing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Heigh-ho, heigh-ho,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">The Clothes-Pins and we,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Will certainly see,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That the clothes will stay here.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The day’s nice and clear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sun’s good and strong,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the wind is quite wrong.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To try such a trick,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But the Clothes-Pins will stick.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“The Clothes-Pins did stick to the line and the Fairies helped them,
singing all the time. The Wind kept on blowing and tried his hardest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
to get the better of the Fairies, but he had no luck at all and the Clothes-Pins
won!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day4">JANUARY 4: The Selfish Oyster Crabs</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“You know, I think oyster-crabs are perhaps the most selfish of
all the sea animals,” began daddy. “The oyster-crabs really
belong to the crab family. They are called oyster-crabs,
however, because above all things they love the juice of an oyster and
absolutely live on it. And what I am going to tell you about now is
the way they get it.</p>

<p>“First of all, the oyster-crab hovers around the oysters and then
picks out a nice, fat, juicy looking oyster, saying to himself: ‘You look
as if you could feed me well without any effort. I think I will crawl
into your shell.’ So then he crawls right inside the oyster’s shell and
proceeds to enjoy himself. He prefers just to ‘sponge’ on others, as
the expression goes!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day5">JANUARY 5: Brownie’s Toothache</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Going to the dentist’s always frightened Evelyn. “Dear
me,” said daddy, “I think I will have to tell you about the
brownie’s trip to the dentist, for I think his case was very
similar to yours.</p>

<p>“This little brownie had had a toothache which had bothered him
for some time, but he dreaded to go to the dentist’s, just the way you
do.</p>

<p>“One day, though, it got awfully painful and he felt he could
stand it no longer. He went right off to see the brownie dentist. He
was a very clever dentist and very kind and gentle. He got a pair of
pullers, and after a moment or two Dr. Brownie said:</p>

<p>“‘Well, here’s the old toothache.’</p>

<p>“‘What, my tooth already out?’ said the little brownie. ‘And to
think of all I’ve suffered before I came to you.’”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day6">JANUARY 6: The Pink Cockatoo</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“On the morning of the birthday of a little girl named Natalie,”
said daddy, “a pink cockatoo was ready to greet her when
she awoke. Well, you can imagine how happy Natalie was.
And she kept saying over and over again:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span></p>

<p>“‘Oh, how lovely you are.’ The cockatoo would raise up his pink
crest on the top of his head at that—just as some people raise up their
foreheads—only his crest went way, way higher. He did that whenever
he felt like it, and he always felt like it when he was being talked
to.</p>

<p>“And after a very short time the cockatoo was just as tame as could
be and he seemed to grow more beautiful every day.</p>

<p>“Before long he began to talk just as a parrot will and follow Natalie
around the house. He had his food out of special little pink dishes
Natalie had given him to match his pink feathers, and every morning
he took his bath in a pink soup bowl which he thought was very fine
indeed.</p>

<p>“Maybe you will think he got spoiled by so much fussing and attention,
but he just became tamer and tamer every day. He learned
many tricks and would often perform them for Natalie’s friends.</p>

<p>“And when it came time for Natalie’s next birthday she gave a party.
On the invitation it said the party was being given by Natalie and the
pink cockatoo. And in one corner was a little colored drawing Natalie
had made of her cockatoo. When the cockatoo saw it he put his
crest way up in the air, and said in a funny voice:</p>

<p>“‘Goodie, Natalie,’ which was his pet name for his Mistress.</p>

<p>“And this is a truly true story, you know.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day7">JANUARY 7: The Pet Monkey</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“Once there was an old lady,” said daddy, “who lived all alone.
One day, though, she went to town and bought a pet monkey.
She named him Niles. He was only seven inches long and
had a curly tail. He was a very dark gray color. He proved to be a
most expensive pet, for he liked all the most delicious fruits and would
only eat his bread and rice when plenty of rich cream was poured over it.
What fascinated him above all was the old lady’s rings.</p>

<p>“When the old lady saw how fond Niles was of jewels she took out
her jewel box. Niles had the most glorious time playing with its contents.
He decorated himself with all the beads and chains and bangles
and looked at himself in the mirror. He shook all over, for he liked
the noise as well as the glitter of the jewels.</p>

<p>“So the old lady was very, very happy with her pet monkey. Niles
was delighted with his new home and his new mistress, for he had never
had jewels to play with in the animal shop.”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“Two children,” said daddy, “were skating on a pond. It was
a blustery, snowy afternoon, and they were the only ones on
the ice.</p>

<p>“A big dog was taking a good run on this cold winter’s day when he
spied the children on the pond.</p>

<p>“He went down to the pond and ran across it a little way, but the
ice had a bad way of creaking, and he was sure it was not so very firm.
He decided that he had better stay around to see that nothing happened
to the children.</p>

<p>“He had been there but a moment or two when a terrific crack in
the ice sounded. It gave way, and the two children fell through. The
sheet of ice broke rapidly, and the water was soon clear for some distance
around them.</p>

<p>“Quickly the dog went to the rescue of the children and swam to the
shore with them. He saw some people drive by in a sleigh on the
road above, and he barked so frantically that they stopped to see what
the trouble was. Then, of course, they drove the two children to their
home. The big dog went along too. The hero simply said ‘Bow-wow!’
when later they fastened a medal on his collar. He wanted to tell
them that he thought they were being very good to him, and he thanked
them, but at the same time he was so modest that he didn’t think he
had been so brave. He felt any other dog would have done just the
same, as he adored children.”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“This evening,” said daddy, “I am going to tell you about the
little boy who was given a jack-knife as a birthday present.
He did so many things with his knife that I think it might
give you some ideas and suggestions of things you might make with the
help of the knife. He set up a little carpentry shop in his room with
a workstand.</p>

<p>“He made little bird-houses, little squirrel houses, chairs, stands,
boats, an express cart, and, oh, countless other things! In fact, he just
made all the things that boys like.</p>

<p>“Before he had his jack-knife he was not at all interested in carpentry.
But his knife helped so much. It was far more useful to him than his
other tools.”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“There was once a little boy who had a sister just about Evelyn’s
age,” said daddy. “He was much disappointed that
his sister didn’t care more for long walks and boys’ games
and that animals seemed to frighten her.</p>

<p>“He used to scold her about it instead of helping her to get over
her fear. One day these two children were taking a walk. They
went into the country along a quiet road. They passed a little house
in which lived an old woman who had a great many cats. She was
very queer and her cats seemed to be queer too. Anyway, it was said
that they hated strangers.</p>

<p>“The little boy didn’t believe this, and when his sister tried to hurry
by he laughed at her.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, come and see this nice cat!’ he said. And he tried to pick
the cat up.</p>

<p>“The cat objected to strangers, as all the people had said, and he
started to scratch the little boy. With a cry his sister rushed to him.
She grabbed the back of the cat and got him off. Then she cried
‘Shoo!’ to the cat, which made him go right home, for he didn’t care
about hurting the little boy. He only would not be played with.</p>

<p>“‘I shall never make fun of you again, sister,’ he said. ‘You saved
me by taking off that cat, of which you were afraid. I have not been at
all a nice brother to you, and I don’t deserve such a good sister, for it
was love for me that made you forget about your fear. But you may be
quite sure I will never make fun of you in the future, for really you
are the brave one.’”</p>

taught them about the berries they must eat and about the things which
would make them feel well and strong. She also told them of the bad
things they must not touch—the things which would make their little
tummies feel very miserable indeed and which would make them quite,
quite sick.</p>

<p>“And when, at last, they went out of the cave, and saw the real
world, the trees and the forest paths, they wanted to start off at once
for adventures, for the world looked so mysterious and wondrous.</p>

<p>“‘Bang,’ suddenly went a gun, and Mother Bear received a slight
wound.</p>

<p>“The baby bears were around her in a flash, but mother bear was
safe, for the man with the gun had hurriedly gone when he had seen
how near the old bear was. And he had seen her teeth and had almost
been able to feel them!</p>

<p>“And the babies knew their teeth would never have done. They,
too, had had a glimpse of their mother’s anger and their mother’s
strength.</p>

<p>“And as they licked the wound they said,</p>

<p>“‘We won’t leave you, Mother Bear. We don’t know the world as

<p>“And Mother Black Bear groaned with the hurt from the slight
wound in her shoulder, but still more she grunted with pleasure, for her

locks of snow and from his hanging snowy sleeves.</p>

<p>“‘They stopped me as I went by the brook,’ said King Snow, ‘and
begged me to have some of their jeweled icicles. Don’t they sparkle
beautifully? Yes, they asked me to have them, and the brook, which

“to think,” he repeated, “that children shouldn’t like us.
Why, children are the nicest creatures in all the world, and
I love them, I do. That’s why I am so unhappy when they talk about
me.”</p>

<p>The Fairy Queen had been listening to this talk and she felt sorry
that so many untrue stories had gone around the children’s world about
Peter Goblin and the goblin brothers.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what I’d do, Peter,” she said.</p>

<p>“Keep on trying to tell as many children as you can how much you
like them. Tell them that in years gone by people were far more nervous
than they are now. They were afraid of the dark and things
like that.</p>

<p>“Tell them that you never jump out at them in the dark, and that you
only come to them when they are asleep. Explain as much and as often
as you can that you never carry them far away from home, but that you
simply sit on their bedposts and talk to them. I’ll help you too,
Peter.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Peter Goblin, as he hopped and jumped away,
for he felt far more cheerful now.</p>

<p>He went to call on his friends, the children. He had a very hard
time with one little girl. “Good evening,” said Peter, as he perched
himself on the edge of the right bedpost of her bed.</p>

<p>She drew the clothes over her head. “Oh, don’t do that,” screamed
Peter. “It will make you have bad dreams and maybe you’ll smother.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear,” thought Peter, “she will dream I’m horrid indeed if she
does that.” But after a moment she poked her head out again and
looked at Peter.</p>

<p>She couldn’t help laughing at him, for he looked so funny and yet
so sad. But still she was frightened, until after she had looked again
(for between looks she hid her face), when she saw two big tears rolling
down Peter Goblin’s funny little face.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, little sir?” she asked. She wanted to be polite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
when he felt so badly and yet he seemed so small and tiny to be called
just Sir.</p>

<p>“I’m blue and sad,” said Peter, “‘cause children think I’m bad.
They think I hide in the dark to catch them. And I love them, and
want to tell them stories. Not a single goblin has ever hurt a child—no,
no, no! Why, we would disown a bad goblin, we would.” And
the little girl promised Peter she’d let all her friends know this.</p>

bread kept a perfectly straight face.</p>

<p>“‘Now, now,’ said the small loaf, ‘don’t be mean and unkind to your
little friend and relative, the small loaf of bread. I’m the only small
one here, though I heard the baker say if folks liked me the size I am
and if mothers bought me for their children he’d make a lot like me.’</p>

‘only we are a little envious. We’ve been the same size always. We
have to follow our relatives who are baked ahead of us and are sold
ahead of us. We always have to follow their example.</p>

<p>“‘But you have been made differently. You have been made a small
size. You’re cunning and different. You are just like us in taste
and shape and kind, but smaller in size and that makes you very
interesting.’</p>

<p>“‘Hush,’ said the small loaf of bread, ‘I am being bought. Hush!’</p>

<p>“And off went the little tiny loaf, in a paper bag, carried by Lucy.
Just as soon as it got home, having been carried all the way, for Lucy
knew it couldn’t walk or run home, a nice fat crust was cut off and
Lucy ate it with joy.</p>

his name too, for whenever she calls ‘Bubsie!’ he replies with a little

the most beautiful songs. He sings so steadily that Elizabeth says
it is a surprise to her that he doesn’t burst his little throat.</p>

before she begins her breakfast. She puts it on her finger between two
wires of the cage, and he hops right over on his little bar and takes it
from her finger.</p>

<p>“The next thing is his bath, which he takes soon after breakfast.
He loves that. He spatters the water about and has just the best
time in the world. He acts as if it were the most wonderful game.
After his bath he has a treat of delicious lettuce to eat, and then he sits
in the sun and smoothes down his feathers.</p>

<p>“In his cage there is a swing, and he swings on it and hops from one
perch to the other. In fact, he has a fine romp. He usually does this
right after his bath, for then he feels so energetic.</p>

<p>“In the afternoon Elizabeth lets him out of his cage. Of course she
sees first that there are no windows up or doors ajar before she
opens the door of the cage. When the cage door is open Bubsie
flies out and makes a tour of the room. How he does enjoy flying
around and perching back of the different pictures and on the window-sill.
The thing he likes more than anything else is to play with Elizabeth.
He perches on her shoulder and walks around on her hand.
And he loves to tease her too, for if there are any flowers in the room
he will fly over to them, peck at them and begin munching at them.
Then he won’t let Elizabeth catch him. He thinks this a huge joke,
and he always flies to some high spot in the room and begins to sing
which is his favorite trick of all.”</p>

<p class="dropcap">“Molly,” began daddy, “was very musical and ever since she
had been a little girl, so little that she had to be lifted to
the piano stool, she had been able to play anything she
heard.</p>

<p>“Her family were far from being well off, but they strove to give
Molly a musical education.</p>

<p>“One day it was decided that Molly was so talented she could give a
concert. So the evening for the concert was decided upon. Molly
practiced and practiced the pieces she was to play.</p>

<p>“She was not at all nervous. She was very proud of her pretty
new dress, for she had always before had the dresses of her older sisters
cut down and made smaller for her. Unknown to her, Molly’s
teacher had invited an old friend of his to the concert. This gentleman
was very rich and fond of music. He liked to help along any one
he felt deserved it. He was so delighted with Molly’s playing that
he rushed up to the little girl, saying: ‘I shall send you and your
mother abroad. There you’ll have the finest music teachers in the
world. You will come back making us all very proud of you.’”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“One night, not long ago, Peter Goblin went a-calling,” said
daddy. “From house to house he went, and in every house
he went to the bedsides of the little boys and girls and invited
them to go on the greatest coasting party of the year.</p>

<p>“‘We’re going to coast,’ said Peter, ‘down the hill of Dreams.’</p>

<p>“They all put their sleds together and down the hill of Dreams they
went until they reached the valley below.</p>

<p>“‘Down this valley all the dreams come,’ said Peter Goblin. ‘Then
our Goblin Dream Workers must tie them up into little packages, for
every nice dream must be saved. It must be made to come true some
day or some time—that is, if it’s all for the very best that it should come
true. For the Goblins are wise little Creatures!’ And as the Children
watched the Goblin Dream Workers they certainly decided they looked
very bright indeed.</p>

<p>“‘They tie the dreams into the little packages and then the Goblin
Visitors take them back to the land of Children and drop them in their
bedrooms at night as they sleep.’</p>

<p>“‘But,’ said the Boys and Girls, ‘we’ve never seen packages like
these.’</p>

<p>“‘No,’ said Peter Goblin. ‘In one of these packages a good many
dreams will come true, and so the contents of the package are dropped,—some
parts in the corners, some around the ceiling. And one by one
they come out into the room later on when they’re COMING TRUE!</p>

<p>“‘So on our way back tonight,’ said Peter, ‘a lot of us will lead you to
your little rooms and we’ll drop the contents of the packages of dreams
which will sometime come true. But now we must be off for more
coasting, hurrah, hurrah!’”</p>

<p class="dropcap">“There was once a little girl named Susan,” said daddy, “who
had in her room a great big glass bowl which held some helleries.”</p>

<p>“What are helleries?” of course asked Evelyn.</p>

<p>“They are fresh-water fish that live in climates where the water is
sure always to be very warm. Susan also kept some snails in the water
with the helleries.</p>

<p>“The helleries are about the size of minnows, but of a different shape,
being more round than the minnows are.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p>“One day Susan saw the big hellery daddy trying to chase the mother
hellery around so that she could not get hold of any of the little ones.
Susan grabbed the mother hellery and put her quickly into a glass of
water that was standing near by. The next thing Susan did was to
count the little helleries and, to her delight, she found that all the twenty
were quite alive. But they had evidently been very much frightened,
for they were all in a corner of the bowl, as near to the daddy hellery
as possible, and the big daddy hellery was quiet and seemed to be much
relieved that the danger was over. The snails, as you can imagine,
were only too glad to rest once more. Susan gave them all some delicious
fish food to comfort them.</p>

<p>“And she kept the mother hellery in a separate bowl until the little
ones were grown up, and then she was welcomed back.”</p>

<p>“Why was she kept in a separate bowl?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“Because the mother hellery doesn’t care for her children until they
are big, and she might harm them. But the daddy loves them, even
when they are little bits of things!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day26">JANUARY 26: The Three Horses</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">In a barn there were three horses and their names were Danny and
Fanny and Prince. Somehow Bobbie, who was the farmer’s
youngest son, always liked it when the horses had their ears up
though he couldn’t have quite told you why. They seemed to be so
very, very friendly then.</p>

<p>Bobbie had been having a very fine day, and as he tumbled into bed
he hardly had time to whisper to his old friend the Dream King. He
used to say, just before he went off to sleep, “Please, Mr. Dream King,
send me nice dreams.”</p>

<p>If he did not feel so dreadfully, dreadfully sleepy he would make his
little speech longer and would say, “Your gracious majesty, Mr. Dream
King, will your royal highness do a poor, humble subject like myself
the great and noble and wondrous honor of sending me most royal and
noble dreams?”</p>

<p>This evening all he said was, “Nice dreams, please.”</p>

<p>Soon, oh, so soon, it seemed as though he saw Danny and Fanny and
Prince walking into his room. And then they stood at the end of the
bed, all in a row.</p>

<p>“Hello, Bobbie,” they said.</p>

<p>“Hello, Danny and Fanny and Prince,” said Bobbie.</p>

<p>“We’ve come to tell you something,” said Fanny.</p>

<p>“It’s something you’ve always wanted to know,” said Danny.</p>

<p>“And because I’m the oldest horse, they’ve given me the honor of
telling it to you,” added Prince.</p>

<p>Then the three horses neighed, looked at each other, smiled their
horse smiles and then looked at Bobbie.</p>

<p>“You’ve always wanted to know why we put our ears straight up
when you’ve come around,” said Prince.</p>

<p>“Oh yes,” said Bobbie, “I’ve always wanted to know if there was
any special reason for it.”</p>

<p>“There is,” said Prince, “and I will tell it to you. When we put
our ears up it’s to tell you we’re feeling pleasant and friendly. When
horses put their ears way back it means they’re cross and that perhaps
they’ll bite. But we have never put our ears back on our heads when
you’ve been around, Bobbie, so it means we always, always like to have
you with us.”</p>

<p>And the next morning when Bobbie got up he went out to his three
friends and kissed them and said, “I know a secret of yours.”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“One evening,” commenced daddy, “when the house was quiet
and still, and every one was sleeping soundly, the tins and
pans began to talk in the kitchen.</p>

<p>“‘I think I am to be congratulated more than any of you,’ said the
egg beater. ‘You see my name means that I beat eggs. But not
only do I beat eggs. I beat cream and all other things they wish to
whip into a fine fluffy state.’</p>

<p>“‘True enough,’ agreed the other pans and tins.</p>

<p>“‘But you see,’ said the egg beater, ‘the wonderful part is that I am
not cross. Imagine being used only as a beater. Imagine forever
whipping everything that comes near you. Isn’t that enough to make
an egg beater cross? But am I cross?’</p>

<p>“And all the pots and pans creaked and said, ‘No.’</p>

<p>“‘Then,’ said the egg beater, ‘it only goes to show that my disposition
is quite perfect. Even whipping and beating everything that
comes my way doesn’t make me cross.’</p>

<p>“‘Listen to me,’ said the cheese grater. ‘Think of what my name
means!’</p>

<p>“What?’ asked the others.</p>

<p>“‘It means I am greater than anything else. No other pot or tin or
pan is named by my name.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh,’ chuckled the gravy spoon, a big, good-natured, easy-going
spoon, ‘you don’t understand at all.’</p>

<p>“‘What don’t I understand?’ asked the cheese grater.</p>

<p>“‘You see I help the gravy at the table and I hear the grownups
and children talk. They say that greater means something finer, bigger,
stronger, more noble than something that is merely great. Now greatest
means the best of all. You see the way they spell your name is
quite different from the way they spell the word that means great.’</p>

<p>“‘And what difference does that make?’ asked the cheese grater,
who was feeling sad.</p>

<p>“‘All the difference in the world,’ said the gravy spoon. ‘It means
something quite different.’</p>

<p>“‘The very idea of making such a mistake,’ said the cheese grater
sadly.</p>

<p>“‘Never mind,’ said the egg beater. ‘I have a really bad name and
I rise above it. I do the best I can and don’t complain. You must do
the same.’</p>

<p>“‘I will,’ said the cheese grater. ‘But I am so disappointed.’</p>

<p>“So the rest of the talk between the tins, pots and pans was not
upon their names and the meanings of them.”</p>

<p class="dropcap">Lucifer and his mistress went for quite a long drive one day.
On their way home his mistress stopped to make a call. Lucifer
stayed alone in the wonderful carriage.</p>

<p>Some common dogs passed by. They were barking and playing and
seemed to be having a very good time. Lucifer looked at them as if he
sometimes longed to be a real dog and to play as other dogs did. But
of course there was his family to be thought of and his background!
He could not disgrace it. He must not try anything different. He
must just stay at home, doing nothing but wear a big bow of ribbon
and hear his mistress tell of what a fine breed he was.</p>

<p>But the other dogs did fill him with envy. He had a strange longing
to be out playing, too. What a stupid life he led! No fun at all.
And he would like to see more of the world. No matter where he
went with his mistress, the world always seemed the same.</p>

<p>He wondered to himself if the dogs would play with him. He barked
and they looked at the victoria and at the poodle dog with the blue bow.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
They seemed to be laughing at him, and for the first time his family
tree didn’t seem of any use. It was simply that the dogs were judging
him for what he was—they didn’t care a bit about his father or his
grandfather.</p>

<p>“Could I join you?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Well, you don’t look as though you amounted to much,” they
said, “but come along. We’ll try to be kind to you.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Lucifer, as he ran along, “I do amount to a great deal.
You don’t know. I have more of a background than any of you.”</p>

<p>“What?” they all asked, with their ears and eyes showing that they
could not believe what they had heard. “Tell us what a background
is,” they asked. “Is it another name for life-saving?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Lucifer, “it means that I needn’t do anything but live up
to my family name. For years and years our family have been of
noble, aristocratic line. I am a dog of wonderful breeding.”</p>

<p>“You’re only snobbish,” they said, and Lucifer felt very badly.
“Why, you poor little dog, we feel sorry for you,” said one bright looking
fox terrier. “Our friends have saved children from drowning this
summer, some have saved lives in fire, and we all try to amount to
something. Pooh, you can’t be your grandfather. Try to be yourself
and amount to something!” And Lucifer joined the dogs to be taken
on a regular dog’s trip.</p>

big berry pies and nuts, for they all wanted to eat mountain food at

the soiled clothes being scrubbed so hard and hung out on the line to
dry. To-morrow they will iron the clothes and then put them back in
the basket all nicely folded. Later they will go in the linen room!
Ah, such joy.’ And Snow purred happily.</p>

<p>“‘Now what in the world do you talk about wash-day and ironing-day
for?’ asked Coal. ‘I can understand it when you talk about mice
because I have never known any creature so fond of them. But what
do you care for clean clothes? You don’t wear them. You can wash
yourself and comb your hair by yourself.’</p>

<p>“‘But I like to lie in clean clothes. Nothing gives me the joy that
the basket of clean clothes does! At least it is one of the joys of my
life. As for the linen closet—well, when they leave the door open I
am happy. I love to lie among the white napkins and pillow covers
and sheets.’</p>

<p>“‘That’s the queerest thing I’ve ever heard,’ said the dog.</p>

I’ve often heard her say that she couldn’t leave the clean clothes in the
basket a moment as I’d lie among them right away. And she never
dared leave the linen closet door open. Of course they don’t know how
fond I am of such a bed,’ added Snow, ‘or they would enjoy having a
bed made for me of clean clothes all the time.’</p>

everything that is fine. How about soiled clothes? Wouldn’t they
feel the same?’</p>

cushions, good food, especially cream and still more especially nice food
from the table—all these things I like.’</p>

they had found. They always found some pantry where
they could get good things to eat, and this pantry was full
of delicious cheese and all sorts of nice things.</p>

<p>“‘Really,’ said Mr. Mouse, ‘I don’t think we could have found a
better pantry. It’s one of the nicest homes we’ve had in a long time.’</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ said Mrs. Mouse. ‘And there are no traps, and there is not
a single Cat in the House. That is what I call right. It’s very wrong
to keep a Cat. They’re such horrid creatures.’</p>

<p>“They would frisk about the pantry, behind the shelves and through
the drawers which were often left half-open.</p>

<p>“‘It is so stupid and inconsiderate,’ said Mr. Mouse, ‘for people to
close all the drawers and lock up their things in tin boxes. For my
part I hate tin boxes. They can’t be bitten and they’re so apt to cut
me when I try to get them opened.’</p>

<p>“‘Yes, they’re horrid,’ said Mrs. Mouse. ‘We can’t open them, no
matter how much we try. I like little cardboard boxes best that we can
nibble through.’</p>

<p>“Now one day the children who lived in the house had been out
coasting all the afternoon. It had been a glorious afternoon, and
they had coasted so hard they were very hungry.</p>

<p>“When they came in they asked their mother for something to eat.</p>

<p>“‘Go and look in the pantry,’ said their mother. ‘You will find
biscuits and jam, and quite a lot to eat in there. As it’s a Saturday
afternoon you may have a little feast.’</p>

<p>“Off went the children to the pantry. Now, the Mice had not
been bothered all afternoon. They had seen the cook leave the kitchen
and the pantry was just off the kitchen.</p>

<p>“‘We’ll have a feast this afternoon,’ said Mother Mouse. And all
the little Mice had thought it was a wonderful scheme to have a
regular feast.</p>

<p>“They had been enjoying themselves and having a splendid time when
the children arrived.</p>

<p>“When they heard the door open and the children coming in, the
Mice scampered to their holes and to their hiding places back on the
shelves. They made a great deal of noise, and some of them squealed
in their hurry to get past each other.</p>

<p>“‘The pantry is full of Mice,’ said the children.</p>

<p>“Meanwhile the Mice were saying, ‘They heard us, and now they
know that we are living here. Well, we’ll just have to move—that’s
all. For somehow people don’t like to have Mice for visitors. It’s
very foolish of them, but they don’t like us!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span></p>

<p>“‘Well,’ said Mr. Mouse, ‘we might as well make the best of it.
Besides this has been a very nice home and perhaps we’ll be lucky and
find another.’</p>

<p class="dropcap">“In the sea,” said daddy, “and far away in the tropics where the
plants and birds and animals are very different from here, there
are floating plant creatures known as Portuguese Men-of-War.</p>

<p>“The reason they’ve been given this name is because some one who
was about to name them decided they looked like old battleships. The
Portuguese Man-of-War is made up of many little creatures all joined
together, just as though many of us were all fastened together in our
villages or in our country places.</p>

<p>“Some of these creatures are very different from each other. The
Portuguese Man-of-War is quite large, and when it is like this it is filled
by a kind of gas which enters into it and which makes it look even
larger than it is.</p>

<p>“It is beautifully colored and it floats on top of the water.</p>

<p>“These parts are the large members of the colony. The rest of them,
or rather a second kind of members of the family, hang from under the
side of these—many little creatures which form the largest part of the
colony.</p>

<p>“Many of them are small and trumpet-shaped, and they are the
ones who do the marketing and get the food for the rest.</p>

<p>“Then there are members of the colony who also hang from under
the many members on top, and they are the fingers or the feelers for
the community.</p>

<p>“There are still others who look like bunches of grapes, and they look
after the baby creatures who come to form a part of this strange
animal-plant.</p>

<p>“Still more of them are like great long ribbons and they are armed
with cells which sting and slay young fishes down in the water. Then
they bring up the food to the other members of the family.</p>

which are a kind of animal-plant life, all help each other. And
they are all of many beautiful colors, and add as much to the beauty of

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day34">FEBRUARY 3: The Circus Dream</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“I want to tell you the story this evening,” said daddy, “of a little
boy named Jay Rial.</p>

<p>“Jay Rial was as nice a little boy as any one could ever hope
to see. Every one liked him and he liked people, too. But the thing
he loved above everything else in the world was the circus.</p>

<p>“He loved the sound of the train whistle which brought the circus to
town, and he loved the old circus which used to travel by the road and
not come by the train at all. He loved the circus band, the clowns, the
animals. He loved the very tent itself, the smell of peanuts, the roars
of the lions, the beautiful ladies who rode the beautiful horses.</p>

<p>“He loved the performers, and every time he went to a circus he
wished his eyes were bigger so he could see more, and he wished that
circus people didn’t have to go to sleep at all.</p>

<p>“He used to follow the circus parade as it came through the town and
he didn’t mind if it was always late, for he could go to the circus grounds
with some of the other boys and see them unpack, and maybe he could
sometimes help a little, too!</p>

<p>“Once he had been allowed to stand in the middle of the sawdust-covered
ring when they were fixing up the tent. That had been a great
moment.</p>

<p>“There was only one thing about circus day which ever made him
sad. That was that sometimes people couldn’t afford to go to the
circus. He had been very lucky. He was always able to do chores for
his mother and daddy around circus time and he could make enough
money for a ticket.</p>

<p>“But there were some little boys and girls who couldn’t do that, or
whose mothers and daddies couldn’t afford to do that for them.</p>

<p>“‘If I ever get to be a big man,’ said little Jay Rial, ‘I’m going to
take just as many children to the circus with me as I can.’</p>

<p>“Little Jay Rial called it his circus-dream. And sometimes he would
really dream that he was taking hundreds and hundreds of little boys<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
and girls whose faces had been sad and teary because they hadn’t thought
they were going to the circus. He had dreamed of how they would
follow after him and would say:</p>

<p>“‘Me, too?’</p>

<p>“And he would smile at them and say, ‘Yes, all of you!’</p>

<p>“It was a beautiful dream.</p>

<p>“Now there are many people who dream of doing something fine
when they have more money or when they’re grown up and who forget
it when that time comes.</p>

<p>“They will excuse themselves by saying, ‘Yes, I have more money
than I used to have, but I find I need it all,’ instead of doing more than
they had been able to do before. There are little boys who say, ‘When
I grow up I’m going to see that poor children get ice-cream once in
a while.’ But when they grow up they forget and they don’t realize that
there are lots of children in hospitals and in homes who very seldom receive
visits from the ice-cream man.</p>

<p>“Now Jay Rial was different. He remembered. When he grew up
he went into the circus business. He was the one who would tell the
newspapers in the different towns in advance when the circus was coming
to town so every one could look forward to it.</p>

<p>“And he remembered his circus dream.</p>

<p>“So every year when the circus came to the very biggest city they
visited, grown up Jay Rial arranged that every child in every hospital
or home or any child who was crippled and not as fortunate as other
children should come to the circus free.</p>

<p>“They arranged one afternoon when no one need buy a ticket but
when every seat was free. And yet, that wasn’t enough for Jay Rial.
When the hospitals and homes sent in their lists of the numbers of children
who would be able to go to the circus the lists grew so long that the
place wouldn’t hold them all.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose Jay Rial said, ‘Sorry, but we’ve room for no more?’
Not a bit of it. He had another circus party for those who couldn’t
come to the first.</p>

<p>“And Jay Rial’s face was full of smiles as he looked at the thousands
of children who were shrieking with joy over the circus, and he said,
‘My dream has come true.’</p>

<p>“But,” ended daddy, “Jay Rial is one of those people who help to
make dreams come true.”</p>

<p class="dropcap">“Mildred had lost her muff,” said daddy. “She lived in a
small town near a big city. She went to school in the city.
Every morning she took the train into the city and came
back by train in the afternoon. When she got home that afternoon
she told her mother and daddy what had happened. Mildred’s daddy
said that he would telephone to the railway station to see if anything
had been seen of it. Mildred stood by listening.</p>

<p>“‘Mildred,’ said her daddy, ‘they’re asking me if your muff had a
head on it. Did it?’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, let me talk, daddy!’ And Mildred grabbed the receiver.</p>

<p>“‘Yes, yes,’ she cried excitedly into the telephone; ‘it had a black
fox’s head on it!’ Then she heard the joyful words:</p>

<p>“‘I think it has been found and brought here.’</p>

<p>“Mildred could hardly wait until the morning came. Then she went
with her daddy to the lost and found department of the railway station.</p>

all those umbrellas and books!’ And she jumped up and down with

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“I’m proud, that is what I am,” said a large piece of coal in the

Coal.”</p>

<p>“But,” said another piece of coal, “you have the idea, I believe, that
his name was spelt as our name is spelt. I think that is wrong. The
king spelt his name Cole. The song you mean goes like this, ‘Old King
Cole was a merry old soul.’ Isn’t that the one you mean?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the large piece of coal which had spoken first. “That is
the old song I mean. A fine one it is, to be sure. But what care I
how the king spelt his name, or how the person who wrote the song
spelt it? My grandfather once lived in a king’s coal-bin in a great
palace. That is, he must have. Of course he never told me about it
myself for he was burnt before I came around. But one of my grandfathers
must have been in a king’s coal-bin and maybe he is still there.
Kings must have coal-bins and be kept warm, mustn’t they?</p>

<p>“Perhaps I’ve a little cousin this very moment crackling and sizzling
and burning for a king, who knows?</p>

<p>“But, now I come to think of it I don’t believe Old King Cole was
good enough to belong to our family. He had to call for things all the
time, whereas we are called for!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, people want us. They never knew before how much they
appreciated us. They didn’t know it until we became a little scarce.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the other pieces of coal, “we can now hold up our coal
heads and say to all the world, ‘Well, now what do you think of the
coal-bin? You think a lot of it if we’re within it, and if the coal-bin
is empty—ah, you’re sad!’</p>

<p>“Yes, that shows our importance. People talk about coal nowadays.
They go around asking each other if they have enough coal. And
people usually answer by saying that they are getting along all right
but they would like to have more.</p>

<p>“They would like to have more of us, we, the fine pieces of coal, the
coal which is at last appreciated, the coal which at last gets thanks for
the warmth it gives, and the coal which is missed so sadly when it isn’t
around!”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the Dream King, “in talking to the Fairy
Queen this afternoon, she said that she had quite a lot to tell me and
she looked very sad.</p>

<p>“It seems that there have been many children lately she has heard

Sally, I heard Mamie say she thought you were awfully mean and selfish.
I told her I didn’t think so. I stood up for you. I was your

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“Inkfishes,” said daddy; “aren’t black at all. In fact, they look
very much like the ordinary jellyfish. But they are called inkfishes
because when an enemy comes near them they drop
ink out of an ink pocket they have near their mouths. You see, they can
see perfectly through the ink, but the other fishes can’t and so when
they dive down again and again and try to catch the inkfishes, they
can’t do it. The water is so black they can’t see anything and they
flounder off into the clear water, while the inkfishes keep out of their
way.</p>

<p>“The jellyfishes and inkfishes are great friends and often visit each
other. Little Kitty Inkfish and Nelly Jellyfish were especially good
friends, and one day Kitty Inkfish asked her mother if she could invite
Nelly Jellyfish to visit her for a whole week. Old Mrs. Inkfish consented,
so Nelly Jellyfish was invited. Such excitement as there was,
and all sorts of entertainments and parties were planned. Nelly Jellyfish
arrived at exactly the hour she was invited to commence her visit.
That afternoon the first party in her honor was to be given, and, of
course, a number of other jellyfishes were invited for the party.</p>

<p>“But a great big, dangerous fish was hovering near. He saw all the
nice fat looking jellyfishes, and he said to himself, ‘Here’s where I have
a supper party too.’ So he dove through the water toward little Nelly
Jellyfish. Oh, how frightened all the jellyfishes were, but as quickly
as possible the inkfishes had dropped ink into the water and made it
so black that the big fish couldn’t see. They all got out of the way,
pulling the jellyfishes with them, and watched, with great amusement,
the great big fish trying to find his way out.</p>

<p>“He coughed and sneezed with the ink in his face and made very
wry faces at the taste of the ink, which made the inkfishes chuckle.</p>

<p>“At last the big fish had left, and all the jellyfishes congratulated
the inkfishes on their wonderful means of protection, and they said
they felt pretty sure that Nelly Jellyfish would be well looked after
on her visit as well as have a wonderful time.”</p>

<p>“‘To my mind, that is nonsense. The cook arranges the
heat and puts us on the stove when she wants to,’ said one of the String-Beans.
‘She takes us off when she sees fit. And she gives us just
what she wants in the way of salt and pepper and butter.’</p>

salt?”’</p>

<p>“‘Neither would she say,’ went on the Stewed Corn, “Are you quite
warm enough, Mr. Corn, or are you too warm? I will open a window
if you wish.” No! We do exactly as we’re told. Mr. Potato,
you are wrong. Yes, I grieve to admit it, but you are quite, quite
wrong.’</p>

<p>“‘I insist upon being well-cooked because if I am not well-cooked,
I am extremely horrid to eat,’ repeated Mr. Leader Potato; ‘I am hard
and not “done” at all. No one likes me then. So they find it is well to
cook me properly.’</p>

<p>“‘We all should be cooked properly,’ said the others.</p>

<p>“‘You all should, it is true,’ said Mr. Leader Potato. ‘But it is
absolutely important that I should be well-cooked. A half-cooked
potato is so extremely disagreeable.’</p>

dogs,” said daddy. “One night they camped near
a small settlement. The old man had found sticks and wood,
and the dogs had carried it along on the sleds. So they had a huge
fire. They got nice and warm and had a supper of the provisions
they’d brought and which, too, the dogs had carried.</p>

<p>“But a storm could be seen coming, and the snow was flying so fast
it was almost blinding. The old man rolled the dogs up in warm
rugs, and then, rolling up in a sleeping bag, he went fast asleep.</p>

<p>“He had not been asleep long before he was awakened by one of
the biggest St. Bernard dogs, who was tugging at his sleeping bag.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span></p>

<p>“‘What is it, my beauty?’ asked the old man. Still the dog tugged
at the bag. The old man was so sleepy at first he was half dazed,
but he opened his eyes. Slowly he realized that some one must be
suffering near-by, for he heard a strange wailing sound as of some one
in distress. He got up, put on some warm things, and, hitching some
of the dogs to a sled, they started out into the blizzard.</p>

<p>“They went toward the place where the sound of the wailing came
from, and there, half buried in the snow, they found a man almost
frozen to death. The old man, with the help of the dogs, put him on
the big sled and dragged him back to their camp. There the old man
rubbed him, and by the fire he began to recover. He said he had
started out for another settlement to find food and had become blinded
by the snow until he could go no farther. He was so grateful to the
old man for saving his life. But the old man told him that the dog had
been the rescuer.”</p>

the birthday would actually be here.</p>

<p>“‘I’m going to stay awake for ages,’ she said to herself, ‘and try to
guess what mother and daddy are going to give me, and what we’ll
have to eat at the party. I do hope it will be ice-cream. I am a little
afraid it won’t be, though, because when I asked mother about it, she

American history he became so impressed with Abraham Lincoln and
his freeing of the slaves and the tragedy of his death, that he said,</p>

boy promised. And when he became king all of the wives and slaves
of the royal palace—four or five hundred—were freed and were
given money and assistance to get fresh starts as free people.</p>

who knew the governess, and I have never told it to you two children
before.</p>

<p>“And while it is splendid to think of a little boy in far-off Siam loving
and following the great example of our splendid Lincoln, still I’ve
been thinking to-day that the greatest thing of all is that we all know
Lincoln so well that we can hardly find a new story to tell of him.</p>

But some of the Romans didn’t like him, and in those days the people
were cruel. If they didn’t like any one or imagined he might do
them harm, they had him beheaded, and Bishop Valentine, as he was
then called, was beheaded.</p>

<p>“His friends felt dreadfully that such a good man should be so
cruelly murdered, and for days they could talk of nothing else but of
the good Bishop Valentine, and they’d tell one another of all his good
deeds and of his love for all people and of his kindnesses. The older
people would tell their children about him until before long they began
to speak of him as St. Valentine, and that name clung to him.</p>

<p>“So that ever since then, through all the years that have passed, he
has always been known as St. Valentine, and although he was so cruelly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
beheaded, still his deeds of charity and kindness will always be known.</p>

<p>“You see, that is why we send valentines around to tell people we’re
thinking of them and are fond of them, and we call them valentines

something more in the way of a nice Inky fluid or drink, and if the
little girl looks the other way, you spill.”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha,” laughed the Ink-Well, “as if you cared whether I trickled
down over you or not. You are made of wood and you don’t care.”</p>

like to be varnished and made over nice and fresh every little while.
It’s just like having one’s face washed.”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“For over two weeks a little boy has followed me around,”
said the Sun.</p>

<p>“Whatever do you mean?” asked the Sun Rays.</p>

<p>“He has been ill. He has had a very, very bad cold. Oh, he has
been so wretched and he has not felt like doing anything. A little boy
is pretty ill when he doesn’t feel like doing anything and wants to stay
quiet.”</p>

<p>“That’s true,” said the Sun Rays. For how often they had seen
small boys scampering and playing, and sometimes they had danced,
too, for joy.</p>

<p>“The doctor comes every day,” continued the Sun. “Sometimes he
comes twice a day, and once he came three times. But every time he
comes he tells the little boy always to sit in the sun! And he has been
following me around. When I am shining into one window in the
morning, there I see the little boy sitting by the window. In the afternoon
when I choose an entirely different part of the house to shine in
the windows, there is the little boy again. And for two weeks he has
been doing this. Just following me around. I do feel so honored.
And you, my good Sun Ray children, you should feel honored too.”</p>

<p>“We do,” said the Sun Rays.</p>

<p>“Listen now!” said the Sun. And they all stopped talking to listen.</p>

<p>There was the little boy sitting by the window, and by him stood
his mother and a big man with a low voice. The man was carrying a
little black satchel and he was talking.</p>

<p>“Well, how are you to-day, my boy?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, much stronger and better,” said the boy. “I almost feel like
getting out again.”</p>

<p>“You’ll be able to in a very few days now.”</p>

<p>“Oh, doctor,” said the mother, “you have saved my little boy’s life.
He was so sick.” But the doctor shook his head.</p>

<p>“I did not save his life,” he said. “The Sun did that. The Sun
fights germs better than medicines or doctors. We are needed to tell
the people to take advantage of the Sun and use it, and we have to tell
them what the trouble is. For the Sun can’t talk. If he could he
would be one of the greatest doctors in the world. For he always
carries his cure with him. Ah, now he helps me drive away the colds,
the many horrid sicknesses that come when little boys have to stay in
the house.”</p>

<p>“Dear father,” said the Sun Rays, “you are really Doctor Sun.”</p>

<p>“And you my little assistant nurses,” said the Sun.</p>

Your visits are so rare.”</p>

you pick up that last word? Was it running around down on the earth
where you heard it as it walked over you?”</p>

<p>“Words don’t run around,” said the Earth, “but the people who use
them do. That word means that your visits are so few. I’d like to
see you oftener.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said the Moon. “Perhaps because I come only now

<p class="dropcap">“A horse,” said daddy, “was very thirsty.</p>

<p>“‘I don’t know how I can go on working so hard without
a drink,’ he was trying to tell his master. But his master
paid no attention.</p>

<p>“On and on they went. The horse’s tongue became so dry. He
hung it out of his mouth, but the master didn’t notice—not even when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
he gave him a pat as he came out from a house where he had left a
package.</p>

<p>“Now, a little fairy was hovering near-by. The fairy was the Princess
Joy and she was in her long dress of mist-fog material. For the
day was misty and there was a light fog. But not enough rain had
fallen for the horse to wet his tongue. He had tried to hold his
mouth open and get a drink that way but the rain-drops were not
coming down. They were feeling shy and not like a trip to the earth.</p>

<p>“‘I’m so thirsty,’ said the horse again to himself.</p>

<p>“‘Thirsty,’ said the Princess Joy. ‘Why doesn’t your master give
you something to drink? You’re a good horse. You go wherever he
wants you to go—and so willingly, too. You’re so loyal and you are
nice with his children and let them play with you whenever they want
to. Can’t he give you a drink?’</p>

<p>“‘He has forgotten,’ said the horse. ‘He doesn’t mean to be cruel.
He has just forgotten—that’s all.’</p>

<p>“‘Well, we’ll attend to that,’ said the Fairy Princess Joy.</p>

<p>“Now she knew that the horse’s master and the ice man did not like
each other. ‘I’ll attend to this,’ she said to herself.</p>

<p>“The ice man was delivering ice from house to house along the same
street where the master was delivering his parcels. The ice man had
his ice in a little hand wagon he was pushing along himself.</p>

<p>“‘You shall have some fine ice water,’ whispered the fairy to the
horse. ‘The best of ice water.’</p>

<p>“The Fairy whispered to the ice man, and though he didn’t know
that the fairy had told him to leave his wagon in just such a place, he
did so.</p>

<p>“‘Now walk up a little bit,’ she said to the horse.</p>

<p>“The horse began to lick a fine piece of ice. Ah, such a drink as
he had. The ice melted so fast against his dry tongue, and there was
a great deal in the side of the wagon. He licked the ice until half of
a piece had gone.</p>

<p>“Just then the ice man and his master came out at the same time.
There the horse was having his drink.</p>

<p>“‘You owe me for a piece of ice,’ said the ice man. ‘I can’t sell
that piece now. Why don’t you give your horse some water? What
are you—cruel to animals, eh?’</p>

<p>“This made the master feel very badly. ‘I forgot,’ he murmured.
‘I shall pay you for the ice and I’ll never forget again.’</p>

<p>“‘The first good speech I’ve heard you make. You’ve always been
too careless and thoughtless before, but now we’ll be friends, and I
do believe you’ll never forget your fine animal again.’ And the master
agreed.”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“There were cats at the Cat Show,” said daddy, “such as
are never seen in any kitchen. Cats on velvet cushions who
looked far too haughty ever, ever to crawl under a good
old stove on a torn cushion. For at this Cat Show there were cats
whose families were old and noble in the history of Catland. And
cats of all colors! They were even lavender and so many other queer
colors for cats to be!</p>

<p>“And such wonderful fur they had! It was soft and silky and
combed so well. They wore bright ribbons, and their cushions
matched! And they were fed the most delicious bits of meat and
fish—and drank cream, real, real cream!</p>

<p>“But two cats were talking. One was named Royalty and the other
Nobility.</p>

<p>“‘What do you think of the Show?’ asked Royalty.</p>

<p>“‘It’s about the same as most,’ said Nobility, with a yawn.</p>

<p>“‘How dull they are!’ snarled Royalty. And some passer-by said,</p>

<p>“‘That cat is so highly bred, you see. Did you notice how he
snarled?’</p>

<p>“‘Isn’t that too absurd!’ said Royalty. ‘As if it were something very
fine to be cross. I’m cross because of these people. They make such
a fuss over me. They spoil me, and then some of my poor
little sisters and brothers are left by these very same people to
starve in the city all summer, while they go off and shut up their
houses!’</p>

<p>“‘What do you mean?’ asked Nobility. ‘You haven’t any sisters or
brothers who live in kitchens, have you?’ And Nobility’s back rose in
surprise.</p>

<p>“‘Indeed, I have,’ said Royalty, ‘and I’m proud of it! Do you for
one moment think that my family were born in Egypt or India—or
Malta—or wherever they say the family came from? Do you know
where my family came from? From the alleys and side streets where
they used to hunt for scraps of food—almost any kind of food.</p>

<p>“‘Then, you see, the family were ambitious, and somehow we became
kitchen cats, and we lived on milk and good food.’</p>

<p>“‘But how did you ever come here?’ asked Nobility.</p>

<p>“‘Because my little master wanted to make some money to buy a
bicycle. He thought perhaps I’d win a prize at a small Show which
was given at that time. He fed me up, put a ribbon around my neck,
and had me sit on a purple cushion. I won a prize and I’ve been
winning them ever since. I was bought for a great deal of money, and
I make a lot! But what does that mean to me? Nothing! All I
want to say is that if only I knew Grown-Up talk I’d say to all these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>

Her chief delight in life was to have all the chickens, geese
and ducks she could, and let them walk anywhere they
pleased. They could go right into the parlor or into the kitchen,
whichever suited their fancy. Luckily, for the good of the parlor,
they really preferred the kitchen. All the food was there, and they
liked to eat better than anything else.</p>

<p>“Now, this old woman was very peculiar, too, and she looked it.
But the funniest thing about her was that all the animals she had were
queer looking too. The geese seemed to be a little different from any
other geese. The ducks had even more hideous feet than most ducks
have, and they were all of rather strange colors.</p>

<p>“One day not very long ago there flew around the neighborhood
a strange looking bird. He seemed to be quite alone.</p>

<p>“But soon, to every one’s surprise, they saw him playing with the
strange looking geese, ducks and chickens that belonged to the old
woman. He never wanted to fly in the house, but they saw that she
brought out water and crumbs to him. And the old woman welcomed

I’m not worthy to recite on Washington’s Birthday.’</p>

his head in his hands, he cried and cried.</p>

<p>“‘You’ve done a thing worthy of George Washington’s Birthday,

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day53">FEBRUARY 22: Father of His Country</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">We all know the old answer to the question of “Who was
George Washington?”</p>

<p>Many a time have we gaily answered the question as
we’ve pounded fists on the table:</p>

<p>“First in war, first in peace, first in the hearts of his countrymen.”
And at the end of that we’ve had a nice little winding up of pounding.</p>

<p>There is hardly a place, it seems, that in some way is not connected
with Washington. Perhaps at one time or another he had made his
headquarters there, or a chair is preserved carefully because Washington
sat in it!</p>

<p>At Mount Vernon, where Washington lived, one can see the very
rooms through which Washington walked, his bed-room, and the very
four-poster bed in which he slept. And around the house are the
grounds which Washington loved and through which he wandered,
down to the banks of the Potomac River.</p>

<p>Time and time again George Washington faced difficulties of a
bitterly hard nature. But he never flinched.</p>

<p>Time and time again Washington saw his men suffering or deserting.
But Washington suffered with them and he never lost courage.</p>

<p>Time and time again Washington was doubted; jealous groups tried
to work against him. But Washington went straight on, doing as he
should and not stooping to “play favorites” or to be a “favorite.”</p>

<p>There was the time, too, when the country he loved doubted him, and
showed him cruel ingratitude. But Washington did not turn from his
course. It was the hardest of all to bear but he was the Father of his
Country and—his children did come back to him.</p>

<p>And then—when everywhere people were singing his praises, shouting
them, exclaiming them, Washington never lost his head.</p>

<p>He never let his own little inner feelings of likes and dislikes keep
him from being fair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span></p>

<p>Always fair, always just, always true to the country whose government
he really made, he is the Father of his Country in truth.</p>

<p>After the Revolutionary War, as after all wars, the country was in
a frightfully upset state and the people were the same. Then it was
that Washington held together the country, made its government, and
slowly but steadily brought order out of the most frightful disorder.</p>

<p>In those days people traveled by stage-coach; cities were small and
far apart, the country was spread out and rumors and prejudices were
hard to overcome.</p>

<p>But all of these tangled threads and oh, so tangled were they,
Washington unraveled!</p>

<p>His Christmas Days, too—often how unlike Christmas they were!
One was spent at Valley Forge when everything was frozen and the
men went forth seeking food. Another was spent at New Windsor
where the suffering from the cold had been intense, but there was brightness
that day because of the arrival of a great wagon filled with shirts
and warm clothing for Washington and his men. And yet another
Christmas was that when the famous crossing of the Delaware River
took place.</p>

<p>Washington—whom historians all call very great.</p>

<p>Washington—the Father of his Country!</p>

<p>“The Creature will argue like this, ‘Now shall I let the Envelope
go as it is, or shall I address a fresh one? There is something queer
about this Ink.’ Then it is that I chuckle. ‘No,’ the Creature continues,
‘I think I will not notice the smudgy spot. Maybe the persons
getting it will think that the rain has made it look so badly—rain
often gets at a letter.’</p>

a lovely white throat, too, and when he went out into the
street he wore a fine big collar, which made him look very
distinguished,” said daddy, “and he belonged to a little boy named Alfred.
Alfred’s mother was a very rich lady, and Rowdy had all the
comforts that any dog could possibly ask for. He slept in Alfred’s
room in a beautiful basket.</p>

<p>“Alfred and Rowdy were really inseparable companions. Alfred
was not a very strong little boy. He couldn’t join in all the sports
that other little boys enjoy. Because of Alfred’s ill health he and
Rowdy were all the better companions.</p>

<p>“Alfred had a phonograph, which he used to play a great deal.
Rowdy would sit before it, so delighted at the music. He’d put his
head first on one side and then on the other. Of course Alfred would
talk to him and ask him how he was enjoying the music. Rowdy would
wag his tail to show he thought it was fine.</p>

<p>“In the afternoons Alfred and his mother used to take drives in a
lovely big open Victoria. One afternoon it was beautifully bright
and sunny. Alfred’s mother said:</p>

<p>“‘We’ll go for a nice long drive to-day.’</p>

going to happen.</p>

<p>“‘Rowdy, how would you like to take a drive? Speak and say if
you would like it.’</p>

<p>“So Rowdy wagged his tail and gave a bark as if to say, ‘Charmed!’
Rowdy’s best collar was put on, and off they started. They had not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
gone far before they passed a poor, pathetic little waif dog. Rowdy
was not snobbish and proud as some dogs might have been, brought up
in all the comforts he had always had. Instead he seemed to feel very
sorry for the little waif dog and whined sadly. Then he tried to jump
out of the carriage.</p>

<p>“‘Do you want to take the little waif dog driving?’ said Alfred to
Rowdy. And Rowdy showed as well as he could that he would like
that tremendously.</p>

<p>“They took the poor little homeless dog back with them and gave
him good food and a nice home. Rowdy seemed to be glad to give such
happiness to a little friendless dog, and he seemed to feel that it was
giving the dog rare pleasure to have a master like Alfred.”</p>

heads of eagles. These four heads in all always made Kenneth wonder,
for they looked so very life-like. He used to imagine that even little
wooden eagles must get very tired of always being just the same. And
late one afternoon, sitting in the chair he fell asleep.</p>

you’ve played so many games. We’re tired because we’re always still.’</p>

he was hearing. ‘Yes,’ said Kenneth very sympathetically, ‘I should
think you would be very dull. I’ve often thought that. Have you
been there a long time?’</p>

had not spoken. ‘We were very old before your daddy got us. We’ve
been on this chair so long. We can’t remember how long. And
what makes us feel so sad is that we are called eagles and should fly

<p class="dropcap">“I must tell you a story about the game of good manners which
they play in a large public school in a big city,” said daddy.
“They are let into the secret that it’s a lesson, but it is a
play-time lesson and they have it in connection with their gymnasium
and play-time work, though it doesn’t take the place of recess.</p>

<p>“And they grow to understand their teachers better, who are teaching
them the game of manners and they get on so much better when
both teachers and pupils understand each other and really like each
other.</p>

<p>“For example, they hear a story of a little boy who didn’t want to
wash his hands or face and who became so dirty that he found himself
without any companion except a pig.</p>

<p>“After they have heard such a story they all act it out, one taking
the part of the dirty little boy, and the others of the people he met
who wouldn’t play with him or have anything to do with him, or invite
him into their homes, or anything nice like that.</p>

<p>“And they take turns in having the story about a boy and about a
girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span></p>

<p>“They hear a story of a very rude boy or girl and of how he grew
up into a cross man or woman, and they hear of his adventures and
what horrible times he had making others miserable as well as himself.</p>

<p>“Then they act out these stories in their classes where they have dramatics
and different ones take the parts of the bad child or the unmannerly
child or the unmannerly grown-up, and of all the people whom
these met with in their adventures.</p>

<p>“And oh, what laughter there is when a boy makes a mistake in
acting his part of the teacher and in being very unlike the teacher and
more like himself which of course is quite natural. Yes, the game of
good manners is a great and successful game in this school where there
are three thousand and six hundred boys and girls.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day59">FEBRUARY 28: Naughty Julius</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“There is nothing more dreadful to my mind,” said daddy,
“than a little boy who is mean to other children not so big
and strong as he is. I once knew a little boy like that and
will tell you about him this evening.</p>

<p>“The little boy’s name was Julius.</p>

<p>“A family came to live one day in the house opposite where Julius
lived. The house had been vacant for a long time, so Julius was delighted
when he found he was to have neighbors. What was his
disappointment, though, to find that the family opposite consisted only
of a mother, daddy and a little sick boy named Hugh. He was cross
when he saw Hugh’s little pale face at the window opposite. He
would laugh at him until he saw the tears trickle down Hugh’s face
and he would turn away from the window.</p>

<p>“One day Julius’ mother came to him and said, ‘Julius, it is very
cruel to make fun of a little sick boy, and I will tell you what is the
trouble with Hugh.</p>

<p>“‘Hugh had his right foot frozen last winter, and he has
had to have it taken off. To-day he is going out for the first time on
his crutches,’ concluded his mother.</p>

<p>“Julius kept very quiet, but inwardly he was planning something
very mean to do. He waited around for some time, and still no sign
of Hugh. At last he saw him, so he shrieked from the window, ‘Hello,
tenderfoot!’</p>

<p>“Hugh was bound he would be brave, so he beat back the tears.
Julius rushed downstairs and out into the street.</p>

<p>“Just at that moment a fast motor-car came along. Julius did not see
it, but Hugh did, and as his little voice was too weak to rise above<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
Julius’ laughter he hobbled on his crutches and pulled Julius out of
the way just in the nick of time. Oh, how frightened Julius was! And
his escape from some terrible injury seemed marvelous.</p>

<p>“In a flash he saw what it would have meant to him to have no
football, no skating, no sports, and the little crippled Hugh he had
laughed at and who had so much to bear had saved him.</p>

<p>“Hugh forgave Julius, and they became fast friends from that time,
and Julius never forgot that Hugh had saved his life.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day60">FEBRUARY 29: The Whistling Boy</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“I am going to tell you a story,” said daddy, “about a whistling
boy. It is a true story too. The boy was asked to a party
and he went.</p>

<p>“All the children were playing games—follow the leader, prisoner’s
base, blind man’s buff, hide and go seek, still-pond-no-more-moving, and
many other games.</p>

<p>“They asked him if he wanted to play and he put his hands in his
pockets and whistled. Then they had supper and they asked him if
he liked creamed chicken and he whistled.</p>

<p>“They asked him if he liked ice-cream and he whistled. And as he
whistled the same three notes whenever he was asked anything they
didn’t know whether he liked ice-cream or not.</p>

<p>“They gave him some supper when everything was passed around and
he whistled when he took his plates and his cup of cocoa. When
he had finished, without saying a word to any other children he got up,
put his hands in his pockets once more and whistled.</p>

<p>“The children began to giggle, for they thought he was such a funny
boy, and a funny boy he was. He had been rather spoilt and he hadn’t
really learned to play with other children.</p>

<p>“They felt very sorry for him, but still he wouldn’t say a word or do
anything. They had asked him to the party because he had just come
to the town to live and they thought he must be lonely.</p>

<p>“Well, when he got home he felt very badly, as many shy people
do who have been rude because they were so shy they didn’t know
what to say, and so did the wrong thing.</p>

<p>“He cried when he was going to bed. And he was much ashamed of
himself, for he thought it was a dreadful thing for a boy to cry.</p>

<p>“After a while he went to sleep, and in his sleep the Dream King
came to him.</p>

<p>“‘I’ll help you,’ said the Dream King, ‘and I will not let you behave
as badly as you did this afternoon if I can help it. For listen,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
Boy. If you whistle again instead of talking and playing I will take
away your tongue for a whole month and you won’t be able to make
any sound.’</p>

<p>“And the dream seemed so real to the boy that he tried his best to
act as other boys, and he succeeded too.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day61">MARCH 1: Lucy’s Tonsils</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Now, there were two tonsils and they had made their home in
Lucy’s throat.</p>

<p>Tonsils always make their homes in throats. They do not
care for other kinds of homes.</p>

<p>They are all alike in that way.</p>

<p>Now people are very different. Some people like to have their
homes in country places. Others like to have their homes in big cities
where there are crowds and crowds of people.</p>

<p>Still others like to have their homes in seaside places, so they can
be neighbors of dear old Mother Ocean.</p>

<p>But tonsils like to make their homes in throats. And these twin
Tonsils were in Lucy’s throat.</p>

<p>One Tonsil was named Ton Tonsil and the other was Tom Tonsil.</p>

<p>“Hello, Ton,” said Tom, “are you up to mischief?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I am,” said Ton. “I’m causing trouble. How about you?”</p>

<p>“Doing all I can think of and I’ve a good many pranks left to play,
too,” said Tom. “I tell you what, we have a loyal and faithful little
friend in Susy Sore Throat. She’s a mean one.</p>

<p>“She’s a good playmate for us. She’s going to be with us to-day.
Gracious me, it’s surprising how Susy does turn up, and half the time
no one knows from where she comes.</p>

<p>“She’s going to bring her little half-brother along with her—you
know—Ronald Raw Throat. They’re very fond of being together.”</p>

<p>“I think we’ll have a fine party,” said Ton Tonsil. “I feel puffed
up with excitement already.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“I tell you Lucy’s throat is a fine home for us,” said Ton.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Tom, “it’s gorgeous. We have had lots of room to
grow big with pride, and we have. We’ve grown big with Tonsil
pride.</p>

<p>“They say it’s not nice for Tonsils to grow so proud because they’ve
nothing to be proud of—but gracious me, that is just the point.</p>

<p>“Things that have no reason to be puffed up and proud are usually
the kind that are most conceited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span></p>

<p>“And those creatures who are modest and not conceited are usually
the ones who can do things. You’ll almost always find it is that way.”</p>

<p>“That’s the way it usually is,” said Ton. “Well, we mustn’t talk any
more. We must get bigger and bigger and just let Lucy know we’re
making ourselves quite at home in her throat.</p>

<p>“In fact, she needn’t think she has any rights to her own throat.
We’re the ones with rights.”</p>

<p>“And don’t forget us,” said the little Adenoid Cousins. “Don’t forget
us.”</p>

<p>“We won’t,” said the Tonsil Twins. “We won’t forget you.”</p>

<p>Along then came Susy Sore Throat and Ronald Raw Throat, and
Carrie Cold came too, and so did Clarence Cough. Oh, they all came
and had a party in Lucy’s throat.</p>

<p>Well, they liked the party so much that they came again and again.
Sometimes they had little parties and sometimes big parties.</p>

<p>One day, however, Lucy decided to let her Tonsils know that they
could not make their home any longer in her throat.</p>

<p>So she went to the big doctor who had promised to take them out
and who had told her that she would get rid of those wretched little
Twins.</p>

<p>It wasn’t pleasant to think of getting rid of the Twins. They
wouldn’t come out by a mere kind word. No, they had to be cut out.
Harsh ways had to be used with them. But Lucy was brave—and she
knew that once she got rid of those wretches her throat would never
again be the place for the Tonsil parties.</p>

<p>So the big doctor took the Tonsil Twins out and their Adenoid Cousins
along with them, and the Tonsils wept red tears as they left Lucy,
but they said each to the other:</p>

<p>“It was all our fault for behaving as we did!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day62">MARCH 2: Lucy’s Visitors</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">The Tonsil Twins had been taken away from Lucy’s throat and
no longer did they make their home there and give the horrible
parties they had been giving for so long a time. And, while
Susy Sore Throat was leaving, nice visitors came to see Lucy.</p>

<p>A most attractive little toy wooden bunny came. His ears could be
moved up and down and a most roguish look he would have when one
ear was up and the other down.</p>

<p>Lucy gave him chicken broth and he was extremely pleased.</p>

<p>If he had not been afraid his wooden face would have cracked he
would surely have smiled. For it was pleasant indeed when one was
only a little wooden bunny rabbit to be given chicken broth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span></p>

<p>It was most superior chicken broth, too. Oh, yes, for it had been
made for Lucy and was made so as to give her lots of extra strength.</p>

<p>Besides the toy bunny a rag doll came to see Lucy. Yes, a very
lovable sweet rag doll came to visit her.</p>

<p>She wore a little knitted hood on her head and a little sweater and
a knitted scarf to keep her warm.</p>

<p>And she had a pair of warm knitted shoes. She wore her outside
jacket, too, over her sweater, and she took along her little apron, so she
could wear that when she played, so as not to hurt her good dress.</p>

<p>Oh, yes, the rag doll was going to play with Lucy and have an
excellent time.</p>

<p>Then many members of the game family came to call on Lucy.
They, too, came ready for play. Yes, there is nothing in the world that
a game is more ready for than a good play.</p>

<p>Then people came to see Lucy, too, and congratulate her on the fact
that the Tonsil Twins and the Adenoid Cousins had left.</p>

<p>A lovely gray felt bunny and a brown felt monkey always were with
Lucy. They had always belonged to her and, though new visitors came,
they did not leave her. The monkey put his arm around the bunny
and with his other arm on the pillow by Lucy he looked most comfortable.</p>

<p>He hadn’t left her when she had gone to have the Tonsil Twins out.
He had been such a comfort. Of course, when they were actually to be
taken out he had to stay behind, but he was with her just as long as he
could be and he joined her again as soon as he could.</p>

<p>“Well,” he was saying to the gray rabbit, “I’m laughing up my
sleeve.”</p>

<p>“How can you do that?” asked the rabbit. “You haven’t any sleeve
and you aren’t laughing up your arm. You’re not even turning your
mouth in that direction.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by saying that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it is just an expression,” said the monkey. “When Creatures
say they’re laughing up their sleeve it does not really mean that they’re
holding open their sleeve and saying:</p>

<p>“‘Ha, ha, ha,’ up it. But it means they’re laughing inwardly or to
themselves or so no one can see their laughter. That is what the expression
means.</p>

<p>“So, you see no one can see my laughter, but I’m laughing all right
at the good joke played on those wretched Tonsil Twins!”</p>

<p>Just then there came another visitor. This time it was the prince of
desserts—Prince Ice-Cream. Proudly the Prince came in on the best
and most royal of saucers and just at that moment Susy Sore Throat
left for good and all.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Daddy had a story about a little dog that he knew would
please both the children.</p>

<p>“Would you like to hear of a little dog who was homesick?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Evelyn, “we would love to hear about it—that is, if he
didn’t die of homesickness.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” said daddy, “this little dog didn’t die of homesickness,
for he was sent home again and then was perfectly happy.</p>

<p>“He was the pet puppy of his mother, and he had told the man who
had sold him to a little girl that he didn’t want to go.</p>

<p>“The man who sold him thought that the little girl would give him
such a nice home, and so she did, but the little puppy wanted more than
just a nice home. He wanted his mother.</p>

<p>“Of course the little girl hadn’t hesitated a moment about buying
him, for he was a beautiful little Boston bull, and she promised him
that she would make him happy.</p>

<p>“Now, when the little girl reached home with her puppy she gave
him a great big bowl of the most delicious warm milk and a good puppy
biscuit. But the puppy wouldn’t touch the milk and biscuit.</p>

<p>“At bedtime the little girl showed the puppy his basket, which was
nice and soft and comfortable. She thought that after a good night’s
rest he would be hungry for his breakfast and feel better.</p>

<p>“But morning came, and the puppy still refused to eat. And, would
you believe it, hours passed, and the puppy still would not eat.</p>

<p>“Then the little girl decided that the only thing to be done was to
take her beautiful puppy back to his mother.</p>

<p>“She ordered her pony cart to be ready for a certain hour, and off
she started, holding the puppy by her side.</p>

<p>“When the puppy came near his home and began to see familiar
sights it was all she could do to keep him in the cart, and when they
were right by his home she could not hold him, for with a bound he
was out and frisked and jumped over his mother, and she did the same,
looking as if they would almost kill each other with joy.</p>

<p>“‘I guess he had better stay home,’ said the man.</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ answered the little girl, ‘this is where he belongs.’”</p>

Ethel,” said daddy.</p>

<p>“One time Lady Ethel’s master took a long ride far out into
the country away from where people lived.</p>

<p>“He felt quite ill after he had ridden a long way, and all of a sudden
he got quite dizzy and fell.</p>

<p>“Lady Ethel pulled him out of the road and off to one side so no
one taking the same road would go dashing over him by mistake.</p>

<p>“And then she went back home, all the distance alone, and neighed
so that the people came out with her and found her master.</p>

<p>“He was quite ill after that, for he had been feeling poorly when he
had started out on his ride, but if it hadn’t been for Lady Ethel he
wouldn’t have had the chance to have been taken home and put back
to bed and nursed back to health.</p>

<p>“He said he was grateful to all who helped him get well, but the one
he was most grateful to of all was the faithful Lady Ethel.</p>

<p>“And every day while he was ill they led her under his window and
she neighed happily after he had called out with as much strength
as he could:</p>

soup. It’s supposed to be quite delicious. And when we’re both well

be eaten as the first thing at the meal. Yes, soup is very apt to take
the lead. It’s a leader, soup is.”</p>

<p>“Good,” said the milk. “But how silly to call it cream of tomato
soup, if they’re going to use me. I’m milk, I am.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” said the tomato, “let them have their little airs and

<p class="dropcap">“Why did you have your toe-nails cut, your skin oiled, and your
feet sand-papered?” asked Sally of an elephant in the Zoo.</p>

<p>“One question at a time please,” said the elephant. “I
can’t answer all three at once, for then the answers would be all jumbled
up. Besides, I don’t know how to say more than one word at a time.</p>

<p>“My nails were cut because they needed it. And, come to think of it,
I can answer all your questions at once. My feet needed to be sand-papered
and my body needed to be oiled. My skin required it, and so
the keeper looked after me, as he did after my friends here.” This he
said waving his trunk.</p>

<p>“But what do you do when you are not in the Zoo?” asked Sally.
“They don’t have sandpaper and nail scissors in the jungles, do they?”</p>

<p>“Ah, that is where you do not understand, and where the keeper does.
In the wilds I can cut my nails on the great rocks. They keep them
short. Here I cannot do it myself, and so the keeper has to do it for
me. And I get the oil for my skin in the swamps when I’m free, and
my feet are kept hard by the ground and rocks. We do not need the
keeper’s scissors and so forth when we are free, for old Mother Nature
looks after those things for us.”</p>

been used so much by boys and girls—especially by boys.</p>

<p>“Then, too, the Elves had played marbles, as years before
they had found out about them and thought they were lots of fun to
play with.</p>

<p>“‘You are nothing but an ordinary Marble,’ said one large and very
blue Marble to a little Marble.</p>

<p>“‘But I am useful for playing. And I joggle along and roll much
better than you do. You are so big. You are quite awkward!’</p>

you. You cost next to nothing. In fact, you didn’t even cost a cent.
Not one whole cent!’</p>

<p>“The Marble rolled along a little way as if it couldn’t be too near
the cheap Marble.</p>

<p>“‘But a cent bought me,’ said the little Marble.</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ said the big Marble proudly, ‘it bought you and also a
number of other marbles, too. You were one of five for a cent. One<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
cent bought you and four others! Now, as for me! well, it took the
whole of five cents to buy me!’</p>

<p>“‘I know it,’ said the little Marble sadly.</p>

<p>“‘My Master only bought me yesterday,’ said the big Marble.
‘His friends have not seen me. They’ll trade everything for me!
Gracious—they’d trade dozens of little Marbles just for me! I cost
five cents!’</p>

<p>“The children had arrived, but they did not seem to want to trade
everything for it! One of them said,</p>

<p>“‘It is a beauty, but then it is not nearly so nice to play with as the
smaller ones; besides, if I gave up a lot of small marbles for that big
one I’d never be able to have a real game.’</p>

<p>“And all the other children said just the same thing.</p>

<p>“They played and they played. But the big Marble was so mad that
it rolled away crookedly and no one thought so much of it.</p>

<p>“After the children had finished playing and had taken their marbles,
and after the Master of the big Marble had put it away with the
smaller ones, the little Marble which had been bought with four others
for a cent said,</p>

<p>“‘Well, you may be handsome and big. But you are not nearly such
fun as we are. Sometimes the cheap things are the most fun. It
doesn’t mean because you cost five cents that you can give more pleasure.’</p>

<p>“‘I’m glad I can’t be used all the time like you all are,’ said the big
Marble. ‘I am too fine for little Marbles, anyway.’</p>

for the children’s games.”</p>

herself, ‘it’s nice to get something from the hot-house once in a while.
I get so sick of these everlasting winter vegetables and apples that we
keep in the cellar. It’s nice to have a few Tomatoes for a change.’</p>

<p>“‘Don’t be frightened,’ she said. ‘I’m not going to hurt you. Instead,
you see this pot of daffodils I am carrying?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ exclaimed Laura. ‘Aren’t they beautiful?’</p>

<p>“‘I am so glad you like them,’ continued the old woman, ‘for they
are for you.’</p>

<p>“‘For me?’ repeated Laura. ‘For me?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ said the old woman. ‘When the spring comes I take a walk
each day, carrying with me a pot of daffodils. When I see some one
sitting in the window of a house looking sick and longing to go out I
just go right in and leave my pot of daffodils, for they are better than
any spring tonic, to my mind.’</p>

<p>“And the yellow flowers smiled at Laura and bobbed their pretty
heads, saying, ‘We’ll make you well.’</p>

<p>“And, sure enough, they really did more toward making Laura well
than anything else. How could she help but feel better with the
bright flowers smiling at her and cheering her up?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day70">MARCH 10: The Tick-Tock Twins</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“Hello, twin Tock,” said Tick, and Tock answered, just as
quickly as anything:</p>

<p>“Hello, Tick.”</p>

<p>They never got tired of saying to each other “Tick” and “Tock.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
They were the two clock twins, as you may have guessed, but sometimes
between their words to each other, sometimes between saying to
each other “Tick” and “Tock,” they talked.</p>

<p>Of course they would only say a few words at a time and those would
be said so very quickly we could not understand them, and anyway
Tick and Tock only talk for each other.</p>

<p>They just speak to each other all day long, as the time goes on.</p>

<p>And they don’t stop at night, but as it would be very hard to understand
their story without leaving out all the ticks and the tocks we will
hear it with those left out.</p>

<p>Really it was like this.</p>

<p>“Hello, Tick.”</p>

<p>“Hello, Tock,” and the “Hello” would be said very quickly so no
one else could hear it.</p>

<p>“Nice-Tick.”</p>

<p>“Nice-Tock.”</p>

<p>“Day-Tick.”</p>

<p>“Day-Tock,” and so on and on, never forgetting the tick and the tock.</p>

<p>“We’re such happy twins,” said Tick.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Tock, “and we never forsake each other. If one of us
can’t go on, the other won’t go alone. There is never a tick without
a tock following right on behind.”</p>

<p>“Ah, you’re so loyal, Tock,” said Tick.</p>

<p>“And so are you,” said Tock.</p>

<p>“There are many clock twins,” said Tick.</p>

<p>“Many,” agreed Tock.</p>

<p>“Every clock has us,” said Tick.</p>

<p>“Every one,” said Tock.</p>

<p>“And if the clock stops, they stop too.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Tock.</p>

<p>“One would never go without the other,” said Tick.</p>

<p>“Of course not,” said Tock.</p>

<p>“It’s nice,” said Tick, “to be so loyal, very nice and very unusual.
Think of how we can always wait for the other, and then follow after!”</p>

<p>“We’re each always following the other,” said Tock.</p>

<p>“I’m glad,” said Tick, “I’m not a boy and you’re not a girl. Then
when we grew up we’d be sent to different schools, and one of us would
go into business and the other might marry and keep house. Dear
me, it’s much nicer to be the clock twins. We’ll never be separated.”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“I’m mad,” said the Fig.</p>

<p>“What are you mad about?” asked the Apple.</p>

<p>The Fig and the Apple were in the fruit dish together, along
with an orange or two and a bunch of grapes.</p>

<p>“What are you mad about?” the rest of the fruit asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, you’d better tell us,” said the Apple. “I’m sure it will make
you feel much, much better.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether it will or not,” said the Fig.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you think it will?” asked the Apple.</p>

<p>“Because it might make me cry, and some one might call me a cry
baby.”</p>

<p>“My dear Fig,” said the Apple, “no one could ever call you a cry
baby, because even if you cried you’re not a baby.”</p>

<p>“But I’ve heard big boys and big girls called cry babies, and they
weren’t babies,” said the Fig.</p>

<p>“All very true,” said the Apple, “but they behaved as babies and once
they had been babies. That is, each one of them had once been a baby.
It would have been impossible for them to have been more than one
baby I suppose.”</p>

<p>“We suppose so, too,” said the rest of the fruit, as it moved in the
fruit dish a little.</p>

<p>“And,” continued the Apple, “they were behaving as though they
hadn’t grown up into boys and girls by crying over some silly little thing.</p>

<p>“You see, Fig, you have never been a baby. You have been a little
fig, but never a little baby. So you couldn’t be a cry baby, though you
might be a cry fig, or a cry little fig. I’m not sure about that.”</p>

<p>“That wouldn’t sound so badly,” said the Fig. “I will have to tell
you what has made me mad, and what may make me cry at any moment.”</p>

<p>“Tell us,” said the Apple.</p>

<p>“Imagine,” said the Fig, “I heard people speak of a person they knew
was mean and horrid and unfair and all that was dreadful as not being
worth a fig. Oh, that was cruel, cruel.”</p>

<p>“I am so glad you told the story,” said the Apple, “for you are being
unhappy for no reason at all. When any one says that a person isn’t
worth thinking about and he wouldn’t give a fig for that person, it
doesn’t mean an insult to the family of figs, but is simply an expression
people have used for a long, long time.” And the Fig was happy again.</p>

<p>But the Fig was more delighted when a lovely child came by the fruit
dish and taking the Fig said, “I simply love figs.”</p>

No one could love him more than I do.’</p>

I know how much they always will love me.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day73">MARCH 13: Ice Box and Furnace</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Now the furnace and the ice box were both in a big cellar.
The ice box was some distance away from the furnace, but
still they were in the same cellar. The ice box was near
a door, which was by some steps. These steps led up to the kitchen
of the house and every one came down to the ice box to get out the
food which was going to be used and the milk and all such things which
belong in an ice box.</p>

<p>Of course, half of the year the furnace wasn’t doing anything, and
in the winter time the ice box did not have nearly so much ice given to it.</p>

<p>“I feel sorry for you,” said the furnace. “Here you are so cold and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
you haven’t even enough warmth about you to make the ice melt
quickly as it does in the summer time.</p>

<p>“You have to be so cold always; even in the winter you have to be
cold. That is the saddest of all. In the summer I’m not so hot myself
but as soon as a cold day comes I am ready to be warm.”</p>

<p>“Ah, furnace, you mustn’t boast too much,” said the ice box. “I’ve
heard the family having great trouble with you. There are days,
sometimes the cold, cold ones, too, when you won’t burn. I’ve even
known you to go out sometimes.</p>

<p>“And oh, how you have made the family shiver. You have made
them fuss over you.”</p>

<p>“And why shouldn’t they fuss over me?” asked the furnace. “I’m
the furnace, I am; the great and warm and powerful furnace. I keep
the whole house warm. I keep all the people in it warm.”</p>

<p>“But you don’t keep them warm when you go out and when you go
slowly and when you won’t burn nicely,” said the ice box.</p>

<p>“That is to show that I won’t let any one think I’m so unimportant
that I don’t have to be noticed and fussed over.”</p>

<p>“It shows that sometimes you are very mean, furnace. Important
and great and wise and clever creatures don’t have to be fussed over.
They’re above it.”</p>

<p>“Look here, young ice box,” said the furnace, “I don’t want any
rules from you. You are a fine thing to talk about a creature keeping
warm. What warmth do you ever give to any one, I’d like to know?”</p>

<p>“You’re right, furnace, I don’t give any warmth. But I am not supposed
to, and you are. I am supposed to keep the ice and to make
folks cool in the hot summer and make the food keep nice and fresh and
cool. I do my work, I do. And you should do yours, you should.”</p>

<p>“I do it all right, never fear,” said the furnace, though it knew that
many a time it had behaved badly. But now it was mad and it went
for all it was worth and the ice box chuckled and said to itself, “The
poor people have been saying how cold they were and how badly the
furnace was behaving. Now the furnace is mad and will behave by
burning and raging for all it is worth.”</p>

<p>And the furnace burned angrily and furiously and how nice and warm
the people kept on that cold winter’s day!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day74">MARCH 14: The Pet Dogs</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“There were five dogs,” said daddy, “who belonged to a boy
who was named Jack.</p>

<p>“Brutus was the largest of all. He was a big Newfoundland
dog. Next came Bogi, another Newfoundland dog, but not so
large as Brutus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span></p>

<p>“Third came Patty, an Irish terrier. Then came Ouji, a cocker
spaniel, and last came Susy, a little fox terrier. When they all stood
together they looked like a flight of stairs, and just as though one could
walk from Susy right up to Brutus.</p>

<p>“‘Ah,’ said Patty, ‘I see something coming my way.’</p>

<p>“All the other dogs looked and Patty said, ‘There is a bug and I’m
going to catch it.’</p>

<p>“But the bug said to itself, ‘I’ll play a joke on that dog.’ And the
bug did play a joke, a very mean joke.</p>

<p>“Patty snapped at the bug and then was about to swallow it when
she had gotten the bug on her tongue, when what should that mean bug
do but turn itself over so that it attached itself to Patty’s tongue, and so
Patty couldn’t swallow it or eat it or anything!</p>

<p>“Then Brutus had a fine idea. He ran for Jack, for he had seen
Jack go to a near-by field to play baseball.</p>

<p>“He ran just as hard as he could and when he reached the field he
didn’t even notice the baseball which had just been hit with the bat.</p>

<p>“The boys were awfully frightened for a moment as they thought
Brutus might get hit by accident with the hard ball, and they called out
to him, but Brutus wasn’t thinking of being afraid of anything.</p>

<p>“But luckily the ball didn’t hit Brutus, and Brutus went right on up
to his master, barking, and showing by his eyes that he wanted to
have Jack follow him.</p>

<p>“‘I guess Brutus wants me for something,’ said Jack, ‘for he wouldn’t
come to the baseball field if it weren’t for something important.’</p>

<p>“So Jack ran quickly home, following Brutus. There he found Patty
with the bug on her tongue and feeling most uncomfortable.</p>

<p>“Jack quickly took the bug off and then Patty no longer looked sick
and miserable.</p>

<p>“She jumped up on Jack and wagged her tail and her eyes looked
very glad and happy as she tried to thank her master. And then she
did quite the sweetest thing ever a dog did. She suddenly seemed to
know that Brutus was the one who had done everything.</p>

<p>“Jack had come quickly when Brutus had called him, for Jack was
always so good to his pets, and Jack had been able to take the bug off
her tongue because he had nice useful hands.</p>

<p>“But Patty knew that it was Brutus who had gone for Jack, and
Brutus who had brought him back so quickly.</p>

<p>“And Patty went over to Brutus, looking so small beside the great
big Newfoundland dog and she licked Brutus’ paws and rolled over on
the grass, saying to Brutus that she was a very grateful, happy, little
dog.</p>

<p>“And then, for a special treat, every one of them had a bone, and
Jack gave himself a piece of cake!” ended daddy.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day76">MARCH 16: The Naughty Colds</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Mr. and Mrs. Cold were having a very good time. Now, when
most people have a good time it means that they’re playing
or singing or laughing or dancing or reading or hearing music.</p>

<p>Perhaps it means they’re having a party of some sort, or perhaps it
may mean they’re in swimming or having a picnic. Oh, there are lots
and lots of ways of having good times as every one knows.</p>

<p>But when Mr. and Mrs. Cold have a good time it is something very
different from what we mean by a good time. In the first place, Mr.
and Mrs. Cold are very disagreeable people. They have always been
disagreeable. Their daddy and mother were the same way, and as for
Aunt Grippe and their Uncle Bronchitis—well, they’re horrid old
creatures, I can tell you.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Cold have very mean children, too. There is Sadie
Sneeze, for example. She has the worst sort of a disposition! She
just loves to plague people and make them as uncomfortable as she can.</p>

<p>Then there is Charlie Cough. He likes to hurt creatures. You can
just imagine how mean he is. And there is Susy Sore Throat, and
Hatty Headache. They are all children of Mr. and Mrs. Cold.</p>

<p>“Let’s go on a trip,” they said to the children.</p>

<p>“All right,” said the children. They always agree to go a-traveling,
and the worst thing about them is that they have many cousins and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
relations, and their cousins and relations are just as busy a-traveling
as they are!</p>

<p>“I think,” said Mrs. Cold, “we’ll go and call on a little girl named
Annette. She is such a nice little girl, I’d like to make her feel uncomfortable.
Let’s give her a good dose of us.”</p>

<p>And the Cold children clapped their hands.</p>

<p>“Is she nice?” they said. And when their mother and daddy said:</p>

<p>“Oh, she is wonderfully nice,” they were just overjoyed. That is
how mean they are. They love to be horrid to nice, nice boys and
girls and grown-ups!</p>

<p>So they picked up their suitcases with plenty of Sadie Sneeze’s best
frocks, and plenty of Charlie Cough’s extra neckties, and lots of Hatty
Headache’s hair ribbons and Susy Sore Throat’s collars and off they
went. Their hair ribbons and collars and dresses aren’t like nice children’s,
for they are mean like themselves!</p>

<p>“Oh, please,” said Annette, when they all arrived, “I didn’t ask you
to come and see me. I don’t need you. I have a nice daddy and a nice
mother all of my own. I don’t want Mr. and Mrs. Cold, and I have
two nice brothers, and I don’t want any others, or even any sisters.
Please go away.”</p>

<p>But the Cold family paid no attention. They were so mean they
liked being where they weren’t wanted.</p>

<p>But the time passed and the dream king found out that Annette had
some horrid visitors. The dream king hurried to tell the fairy queen
about it.</p>

<p>“Did you ever hear of such rudeness and such unkindness as that
horrible Cold family show?” he said.</p>

<p>“We’ll put a stop to this, Dream King,” said the fairy queen.
“Thank you for telling me. I know that little girl Annette. Yes, I
know her well. She has golden hair and fair skin and blue eyes. And
she lives in a city house. Ah, yes, I know her. Just like that horrid
Cold family to go and bother some one who is nice!”</p>

<p>The fairy queen set to work. She called together all her assistants
and they hurried to Annette’s house when she was fast asleep.</p>

<p>They gave the Cold family a good talking to and they waved their
wands over Annette so that the Cold family were driven away.</p>

<p>And in the meantime the old dream king had told the dream fairies
about Annette and they made up the most wonderful package of dreams,
lovely dreams sent to her as she was getting all, all well again. But
the dream king himself made up this poem for her:</p>

cannot live and thrive where the shamrock grows.</p>

<p>“But there is a legend about St. Patrick which I think I’ll have to tell
you to-night.</p>

<p>“What are said to be St. Patrick’s footprints can be seen on the rocks
off the shore by the Skerries harbor. The story goes that once a chieftain
named Dichu drew his sword to strike St. Patrick. When he was
about to do this cruel deed his own arm became perfectly stiff until he
said he’d be obedient to St. Patrick. Then St. Patrick taught him to
be good and kind.</p>

<p>“Still another interesting story is that of the idol worshipers. St.
Patrick went into the place where these people were and found them
worshiping the idols. There was a huge pillar of stone with the chief
idol on top of it. It was covered with slabs of gold and silver, and
around it in a circle were twelve other idols. St. Patrick smote the
chief idol with his crozier and the idol crumbled to dust at once.”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“Daddy, do tell us this evening more about St. Patrick,” asked
Jack and Evelyn.</p>

<p>“He was born in 372,” said daddy. “When he was only
sixteen years old he was stolen by pirates. They did not treat him at
all well, and he was sold by them into slavery in Ireland.</p>

<p>“His master had him look after pigs in the mountains. But Patrick
had a strange dream in which the Lord told him to run away and set
out for a far-away country. He had been seven years in Ireland, so
he was used to its language and all its customs and manners. After a
time he was ordained a deacon, then a priest, and finally he became a
bishop. At this point the pope told him to return to Ireland to preach
the gospel to the Irish people. Since then he has always been known
as St. Patrick. One story is that on a bitter cold morning St. Patrick
and a number of his followers found they could not possibly build a fire.
They had had no breakfast and were half frozen. St. Patrick listened
to their complaints for a while, and then he told them to gather up the
snow in a pile. This they did. St. Patrick breathed on it, and it became
a fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span></p>

<p>“Another tale is that St. Patrick beat the drum so loudly when driving
the snakes out of Ireland that he knocked a hole in it, but that an angel
appeared and mended it, so that the drum was afterward kept as a relic.</p>

<p>“It is told that in one part of Ireland from which St. Patrick drove
the snakes and toads he chained one huge serpent by a lake called in
Irish Lough Dilveen and told him to stay until Monday. The people
around the district still claim that every Monday they hear the serpent
calling out in the Irish dialect, ‘It’s a long Monday, St. Patrick!’</p>

<p>“St. Patrick is said to have died on the 17th of March, 493, aged
121. His grave is at Dunpatrick, Ireland, and a tombstone now bears
his name cut in Irish characters.”</p>

one day in a clock shop when the old clock mender had gone
to his lunch,” said daddy.</p>

<p>“‘My master is so lazy!’ said the Eight-Day Clock. ‘He keeps saying:
“Oh, dear, I must wind up that Clock.” And then he grabs
a newspaper and sits down and reads. He quite forgets about me.
He should wind me up when it is time. Gracious, I strike so he can
tell I need to be wound up. But he doesn’t pay much attention. He
just winds me up after I have had to stop for days. And such a fine
Clock as I am, too.’</p>

<p>“‘You may be a fine Clock,’ said the little Watch with the broken
mainspring, ‘but I don’t see as it does you any good. You are always
being brought here.’</p>

<p>“‘I can’t help it,’ said the Eight-Day Clock. ‘You see, I get so
upset over not being wound up and I get so tired and worried wondering
if my master will remember, that I get feeling run down. Then
I weep a Clock’s tears, which only we Clocks and Watches know about.
We feel so badly when we are not treated right. And then when we
feel badly it upsets our works and we have to be brought to the clock
mender’s shop. But I wish we could teach our masters a lesson,’ said
the Eight-Day Clock.</p>

<p>“‘We will,’ said the Cuckoo Clock.</p>

<p>“‘What will we do?’ asked the rest.</p>

<p>“‘We will be so hard to mend,’ said the Cuckoo Clock, ‘that we will
make the clock mender charge great big prices. And then our masters
will look after us.’ And all the Clocks at once looked happier.”</p>

<p>“No, Polly doesn’t want a cracker, ha, ha,” the parrot continued.
“For there is no one in the room to give me a cracker,
and I’ve eaten up the one I had in my cage. I have some seed and
some water, but not a trace of a cracker.”</p>

<p>Polly, the parrot, stepped out of her cage and looked about the
room. She flew this way and that, and she had a good-sized room
in which to fly—a room with very high ceilings.</p>

<p>“Polly doesn’t see a cracker,” she said to herself. She couldn’t talk
to any one else, you see, because there was no one else in the room.
And she knew perfectly well that the pictures on the walls and the
rugs on the floor didn’t care about being talked to. She had never
heard them say anything or fly about or walk about—and she knew
very well why they couldn’t.</p>

<p>Because they weren’t live things. They weren’t people, nor were
they animals, nor birds. They were nothing but rugs and pictures
and extremely, extremely silly.</p>

<p>She hadn’t been looking about long when her mistress came in all
dressed up in a most beautiful manner.</p>

<p>“Well, Polly,” her mistress said, “we are having a party to-day.”</p>

<p>“Polly have a party, Polly have a party,” said the parrot.</p>

<p>And when the guests arrived Polly looked down from her perch and
said: “Polly have a party, Polly have a party.” How every one did
laugh and admire the nice, cheerful, friendly Polly Parrot. And her
mistress was very proud of Polly!</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“Creatures and things aren’t to be admired who won’t take
the trouble to go out of their way to do nice things,” said
Sugar of the Sugar Bowl. “And as the Sugar Bowl can’t
go walking around looking for nice things to do at least it can admire
the Salt Cellar and the Pepper Shaker for the work they do in
seasoning and making things have a good taste.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Sugar Bowl,” said the Salt Cellar, “I am glad to hear you
talk this way. For some time I have been afraid that you didn’t have
enough character. I was very much afraid that you were becoming
too sugary and too weak!</p>

<p>“The Pepper Shaker would tell you, too, how much he thinks of you,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
but if he comes about too much he is apt to make people sneeze. He
doesn’t like to do that. He can’t help it if too much of him is used,
but he hates to be used like that. He likes to add to the taste of
things, but not to be made out a cruel creature.</p>

<p>“Yes, he had a terrible blow once. He was treated so badly! It
wasn’t fair to him at all.</p>

<p>“Some very mean boys and girls thought it would be fun to put
sneezing powder in the flowers which they would give to their friends
to smell. Then as their friends began to sneeze they would laugh.</p>

<p>“Well, a great deal of my Pepper friend was used then. He made
those people sneeze and he didn’t want to in the least. Oh, he did
feel so badly about it. It wasn’t funny, he said, it was mean, out
and out mean! The people who sneezed were miserable. Their noses
hurt, their throats hurt and they couldn’t sleep for several nights.</p>

<p>“One little girl who had sneezed so hard and so much lost her voice
for several days, for the sneezing powder got down in her throat, and
her throat has never been quite so strong since.</p>

<p>“So I think we should all be used in our places and not too much
of any of us, for if too much sugar is used things will be sickish and if
too much pepper or salt is used the poor pepper and salt creatures are
taken a mean advantage of!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day82">MARCH 22: A Sun Parlor for Birds</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“There was once a grown-up lady,” said daddy, “who had
loved the stories of the fairies and of birds and flowers
when she had been a little girl. She had so loved to read of
all the kind deeds of the fairies that she had made up her mind that
when she grew up she would do something kind too.</p>

<p>“Well, this lady had the roof of her house made into a Sun Parlor.
There were trees all round, and moss, and little pools of water which
she had fixed to look as much like out-of-doors as possible. The
Sun Parlor she had inclosed in glass. Of course the glass made the
sun shine through all the brighter. And she had little wee doors so
the birds could get in and out, but so small that a cat could never get
into this bird home.</p>

<p>“But still more wonderful was a big cellar where all kinds of good
apples, bread crumbs, more water and countless goodies were kept.”</p>

<p>“But how could the birds get from the roof to the cellar?” asked
Jack.</p>

<p>“I don’t wonder you ask that,” said daddy. “The lady had all
that part beautifully arranged. In the Sun Parlor were tunnels which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
led down into the cellar, and the birds used to love going through these
dark passages into the ‘Goody-shop’ as it was called in Bird language—and
it sounded the same to them as it would to you in Boy-and-Girl
language.</p>

<p>“At first the birds were tempted into their winter home by the
bread crumbs that were in the Sun Parlor. For, of course, as you can
imagine, it took the birds some time to get used to a beautiful summer
home in the winter that was really just for them. Soon, though, little
birds know when people are being kind to them.</p>

<p>“Of course the lady let all the birds who wanted to come in have
just as good a time and stay just as long as they wanted to. But
she especially wanted little sick birds who had perhaps fallen out of
their nests.</p>

<p>“One day the lady came across a baby Robin whose family had
arrived before the warm weather. The baby Robin had fallen from
its nest, and very gently the lady picked him up and took him
to the Sun Parlor. The mother was crying near-by for she saw
her baby being taken away from her and she couldn’t help at all.</p>

<p>“But she saw from the top of a tree where her little sick baby was
taken. How happy and relieved she was—for, of course, she had to
be in her nest with all the other little Robins. But she sang every day
the most wonderful songs for the lady who watched over her baby
Robin until it was quite strong and able to fly.”</p>

I scare folks, and children just run when they see me coming.
But it does seem a pity. Yes, it seems a shame that I can’t
help it.</p>

<p>“One day I was resting. My owner had gone inside a building. I
heard a little girl and an old lady talking. The little girl said, ‘I’ve
been quite ill and my heart is just beginning to get strong. I have a
horrible time crossing the street, for I simply cannot walk across.
Those old automobiles make me run.’</p>

<p>“The old lady said to the little girl, ‘I know just how you feel, my
dear, for I have been ill too, and I am not supposed to run fast. It
hurts me when I run fast and yet I have to hurry to get out of the
way of the automobiles.’</p>

<p>“‘I don’t see why they have to make people run, when they’re not
going to fires and they’re not going after accidents,’ said the little girl.
‘It does not seem fair in the least.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span></p>

<p>“‘It doesn’t,’ said the old lady. ‘But I don’t suppose the people
who run automobiles are ever sick. They don’t know what it means
to have a horn tooted at them when they feel they cannot run.</p>

<p>“‘And it seems a pity that folks should be in so much of a hurry, as
they run along in their automobiles, that they can’t give those who are
walking a fair chance, too.’</p>

<p>“Sometimes I wish I weren’t an automobile.”</p>

<p>“Sometimes I wish I were one with a different owner,” said the second
automobile.</p>

<p>“Maybe we will be sold and nice people will own us, who will consider
those who are walking,” said the first automobile.</p>

<p>“Let’s hope so,” said the second automobile.</p>

<p>“There’s the first star of the evening,” said the first automobile.
“We’ll make a wish.”</p>

<p>So the modern automobiles wished in the old, old way, their wishes!</p>

<p class="dropcap">“The telephone always seemed very important to Rogue, the
collie,” said daddy. “He had known his mistress to rush
out after the telephone had rung and she had answered it,
as if some one were ill, or something had happened which she had
found to be of very great importance.</p>

<p>“She was working in the garden one day when Rogue heard the telephone
ring. Evidently she didn’t hear it, for she stayed out in the
garden and didn’t come in to answer it. It rang and it rang, and Rogue
didn’t know what to do.</p>

<p>“Finally he thought up a scheme, and this is what he did. He ran
out in the garden and he stood before his mistress and barked and
barked without stopping. First she stroked him and didn’t seem to
think anything special was the matter, but that, perhaps, he wanted to
play.</p>

<p>“He kept on barking, and after a few minutes she said: ‘What
is the matter, Rogue?’</p>

<p>“He started to go towards the house, barking, and turned around
to see if she were following him. When she didn’t he went and pulled
at her skirt. Then she went into the house, following Rogue, and he
stopped before the telephone which was still ringing.</p>

<p>“She answered it and found that it had been ringing a long time, but
it was so important that they had kept on ringing to see if she wouldn’t
hear it after a while.</p>

<p>“Then she knew that Rogue had let her know the telephone was
ringing and wanted her to come to answer it, for that was something
he couldn’t do. But he could let her know that it was ringing, now
that he had found a way of doing so.</p>

<p>“And now Rogue always lets his mistress know when the telephone
is ringing. She works in her garden a great deal but she never misses
a telephone call because Rogue hears it, barks for her, and leads her
in before the telephone.”</p>

<p>“May we talk to you, then?” asked Mr. Measles, as he hurried off.</p>

<p>“Yes, I will come and talk to you, but you mustn’t stay around here.
Goblins don’t get measles, but children do, and I won’t have it. Hurry
off. Hurry off.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t they like to have us?” asked Mr. Mumps. “Just think
how we’d make their faces puff up and look so fine and fat.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Peter Goblin, crossly, “and make it hard for them to
swallow. No sir, no sir, you get right away from here.”</p>

<p>“How about me?” asked Mrs. Croup.</p>

<p>“You go away, too,” said Peter Goblin.</p>

<p>“Can’t I have just one little look at a nice little boy or a nice little
girl?” asked Master Chicken-Pox.</p>

<p>“You most certainly cannot,” said Peter Goblin.</p>

<p>“I don’t see why not,” said Mr. Measles crossly. He had come back
a little because he had heard the others talking to Peter Goblin and he
thought perhaps Peter had given in. Of course he had never known
him to, but he might—one could never tell.</p>

<p>“I thought I’d told you to start off,” said Peter Goblin. “Now I
won’t put up with any more of this nonsense. Be off—all of you. Be
off, right away.”</p>

<p>“You promised to talk to us,” said Mr. Measles. “You will, won’t
you?”</p>

<p>“But we’d rather have a little chat with a child first,” said Mr.
Mumps.</p>

<p>“Maybe you would like to,” said Peter Goblin, “but you’re not going
to. And so, one, two, three—go! Every one of you. I’ll follow
along.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span></p>

<p>“Now, what is the use,” Mr. Mumps muttered, “of being able to
make some folks fat when one isn’t given the chance?”</p>

<p>“You don’t want to make them fat and well,” said Peter Goblin.</p>

<p>They had all wandered quite far away from the children and so Peter
Goblin felt they were safe. He would get many of his goblins right
to work to keep an eye on them, for goblins cannot get measles, mumps,
chicken-pox or croup.</p>

<p>“Yes, I make them fat,” said Mr. Mumps. “I never bother about
more than their cheeks. They grumble so after I’ve made them fat
that I get disheartened.”</p>

<p>“Good thing you do,” said Peter Goblin. “You’re certainly mean
enough.”</p>

<p>Mr. Mumps knew Peter was right, so didn’t say another word. Mr.
Measles spoke next.</p>

<p>“We wanted to have you talk to us,” said Mr. Measles, “because
we cannot understand you.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Peter Goblin. “I try to protect the children
from getting measles, mumps, chicken-pox and croup. Of course they
have to help me by trying to keep as well and strong as they can so as
to escape you. Whenever one of you gets past us, how badly we do
feel. You often do, but we try our best to keep you out. We can’t
keep you out entirely but we can help.</p>

<p>“And then good, kind doctors drive you away.”</p>

<p>“We hate doctors,” said Mr. Measles.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mrs. Croup, “we shouldn’t hate them so much, because
we give them a lot of trouble, and we love to give trouble.”</p>

<p>“That’s so, we do,” said Master Chicken-Pox.</p>

<p>“But,” said Mr. Measles, “people say, ‘oh, don’t catch the measles.
And be careful not to catch the mumps. Don’t go near any one with
chicken-pox or you might catch it.’”</p>

<p>“Now, to catch a thing,” continued Mr. Measles, “means to chase
after it or try to get it in some way. If they don’t like us why do they
talk about catching measles? They say ‘Be careful not to catch Mr.
Mumps.’ It’s very silly, for if they really don’t like us, they should
say, ‘Don’t let Mr. Mumps catch you.’”</p>

<p>“It’s rather an absurd expression,” admitted Peter Goblin, “but stay
away from children and talk about it for a good long while. That’s
what you must all do!”</p>

so eager to see the spring.</p>

anyway. It always makes me so mad that I just hang around and hang
around, and laugh when I hear folks say: “Isn’t the winter ever
going?”’</p>

<p>“‘To-morrow,’ said the winter. ‘Yes, by to-morrow I’ll really have
to go. And after this last little snow-storm there’ll be no more until
next year. Ah, what a sad thought that is to me, though it’s not such
a sad thought for others. They seem to be so absurdly fond of young
spring. They spoil him frightfully.’</p>

<p>“‘And you won’t really send any more blizzards?’ asked Mr. Sun.</p>

the people! They’ll think it’s really spring, and then I’ll give them
my fine farewell to-morrow.’</p>

<p>“And sure enough on the morrow there was a light fall of snow.
The spring hardly knew what to make of it at first, until he found it
was so light a storm.</p>

jump from the apple tree to her window-sill, where they were very
likely to find nuts waiting for them.</p>

<p>“When the days began to get a little warmer Gwen hung just outside
the window-sill a little hammock and waited to see if the squirrels would
dare to swing in it. Having all the nuts Gwen put on her window-sill
and seeing her do such kind things so often made them pretty tame.
And, too, they appeared to realize that it was Gwen who had seen to
the building of the little house.</p>

<p>“But the hammock seemed very strange to them at first. However,
one very brave squirrel thought he’d try it and jumped into the
hammock. Gwen was watching back of a curtain, and it was all she
could do to keep from crying aloud with joy, for she was so pleased
that one of the squirrels was actually using her little hammock. After
a while the other squirrels tried it.</p>

<p>“Before long one of the old squirrels began to scold for all he was
worth. Oh, he was very much annoyed, and all the squirrels stopped
swinging in the hammock. They seemed to be paying great attention
to the old squirrel, and Gwen wondered what it was all about.</p>

<p>“The old squirrel was the leader, and he was the one who always
gave the directions and did all the managing. This, in squirrel
language, was what he said:</p>

<p>“‘Now, don’t you know you can’t spend all your time idling! You
are the laziest lot of squirrels I have ever known. Don’t you know
that you must get to work? This is the season for us to tap the sirup<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
from the maple trees, and you are spending your time swinging in a
hammock. It is all very well to play, but then there is work to be done.
We don’t want to waste our time and let all the good sap go, do we?
And you really do want the maple sirup, don’t you?’</p>

<p>“Off they started to scamper to the nearest maple tree. Gwen put
on her hat and coat and followed along to see what they were going
to do. They got all the sap they wanted and smacked their lips over
it. They enjoyed the work really, for it meant good times to follow,
and they were glad the wise old squirrel had told them about it in plenty
of time.”</p>

the gentlemen birds do the marketing when the mother birds are

said that though we did not go to the same markets as people we went
marketing, too.</p>

and began digging up all the worms! Gracious, the poor birds would
have a dreadful time!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day93">APRIL 2: The Buds’ Secrets</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“Some of the tree buds,” said daddy, “were talking about themselves
softly. ‘We do so enjoy being liked,’ said the little bud
which had grown the most. ‘We love to be encouraged—helped
along.’</p>

<p>“‘But how can any one help a bud?’ asked a Fairy who happened
along then.</p>

<p>“‘The Sun encourages us by shining and smiling at us. The South
Wind whispers secrets to us and we are helped so much by the secrets—for
the South Wind tells us such lovely things. And she promises
us more sunshine, more warmth, more brightness. And then there
are the Clouds and their promises. They tell us they will not forget
about the April showers. They never have, and I don’t believe they
ever will.’</p>

<p>“‘And,’ the bud continued, ‘it is so glorious to burst into bud
and bloom again after a long winter when the branches of the tree
are bare that we like to do it slowly and enjoy every second of it.
Besides, the tree has been so used to being lonely that it would
be too much of a shock if we came forth all at once. We just peep
forth first of all and tell the tree that we are coming, for spring is
here.’</p>

<p>“‘Ah, how young I feel,’ said a very little bud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span></p>

<p>“‘We all feel so young, too,’ said the other buds.</p>

<p>“‘You are all wonderfully young,’ said the Fairy. ‘You are buds,
wonderful spring buds, and you’ll soon be leaves!’</p>

<p>“The buds came forth a little more and smiled gently at the Fairy
to show her how pleased they were at the kind things she was saying
to them, and when they smiled a little more green showed.</p>

<p>“The grown-ups that day said, ‘How far the buds came out to-day.
They’ll soon be leaves if they keep coming out at this rate.’</p>

<p>“But the little Fairy knew the secrets of the buds.”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“Now when I say,” the watch began, “that I have to hurry
and catch up—or rather try to catch up—I mean that my
master has a foolish way of trying to hurry me up at the
last moment. He waits and fusses and wastes his time, and then he
wonders how he can reach somewhere on time—reaching there almost
before he starts if he wants to be on time. Then I hurry and try to
catch up to him as he seems in such a rush. And the trouble is I’m
way ahead of the time he wants me to be. I try to keep up with his
hurrying—for after he has wasted a great deal of time he does try
to hurry. In fact he runs around all day trying to catch up with
himself, and I run around with him. But it’s of no use. He tried
putting me way ahead of time one day not long ago, but it was senseless
when I disagreed with every other watch, and every one said to
my master, ‘Your watch is fast.’ We watches must agree, you know,
and so I just get nervous trying to catch up with the lost moments
for my master, and the only thing, I think, for him to do is to expect
less of me and to start off everything ON TIME!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day95">APRIL 4: Billie’s Springtime</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“I’d like to tell my story,” said Billie to the Fairy Wondrous Secrets.
“People are always wondering what babies think about
and what they are planning to do when they grow up—if they
are planning to do anything or not. They wonder so much about us,
and so I’d like to tell my story. I don’t know about other babies.
But I would like to tell about myself, if no one minds.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to hear,” said the Fairy Wondrous Secrets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span></p>

<p>Now Billie was in a baby-carriage which was out on the front porch
of a little house in the country. Billie’s mother was busy and so was
Billie’s daddy, but Billie, they knew, was quite safe in the carriage on the
porch where the soft spring air was blowing.</p>

<p>No one was around but the Fairy Wondrous Secrets and if any one
had come around the Fairy Wondrous Secrets would have vanished
quickly.</p>

<p>“I’m really a little girl,” Billie began, “though my name is something
like a boy’s name, I believe. You see my great big daddy’s name is
Bill and my mother wanted to name me after him. She couldn’t have
my real name Billie, but she had every one call me that, so it’s my
daytime every-day name, and my best, dress-up name is Mary Ann,
or Marion or some such fine name after my mother.</p>

<p>“I came to the world in December,” said Billie. “You see, Fairy,
I thought it would be fun to arrive in the world when everything was
so exciting. Christmas was coming on and it was very gay and merry.</p>

<p>“I’ve had a nice winter, but now is the best time I’ve known, for
it’s springtime. And I’ll tell you, Fairy Wondrous Secrets, I feel as
though it were all my own springtime.</p>

<p>“I feel the soft, warm wind blow over my little pink cheeks which
every one admires so much and I smile and I croon and I make soft
little singing sounds as the trees do. And I look around to smile
at the trees and the bushes, too, and to let them see my blue eyes. I
ask them if they think my eyes look like the blue sky, for the bushes and
the trees are always looking up at the sky, so they should surely know.</p>

<p>“I can see the yellow forsythia upon the bushes, and how gay and
lovely it is. The lilacs are in bud, and there are white blossoms on
the bushes. Back of our house there are some waterfalls and they
laugh and gurgle as they dash over the rocks, something the way I
laugh and gurgle.</p>

<p>“I believe it is their way of kicking with fun. I kick with fun when
my mother puts me in the wash-basin every morning. The wash-basin,
Fairy Wondrous Secrets, is my bathtub, and I splash and kick and
laugh and have such a good time! I don’t care if the water spills over
the floor any more than I imagine the waterfalls care that they spill
water over the rocks. They enjoy it! So do I!</p>

<p>“I can see the ducks and hear them quack, quack. I hear that sometimes
they lay seven eggs a day. The chickens and the hens and the
roosters walk about and chatter, and one day a lady passed and said
‘Hello,’ to a chicken and the chicken got up from the ground most
politely as a mannerly person would do, I’m told.</p>

<p>“The pussy-willows are out and the skunk-cabbage is in bloom.
There are red flowers and yellow flowers and little star flowers. The
trees are full of buds or little leaves or blossoms of different colors.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
There is a little turtle who is sunning himself by the brook near-by
and who is an interesting creature, I have heard. He wears a shell
over his back as I wear a little knitted jacket.</p>

<p>“At night I hear the crickets when I wake up for my bottle. And
I believe these creatures all like the country, too. The chickens and
the ducks say that in the cities they aren’t wanted and they wouldn’t
be allowed to wander about, so they wouldn’t leave the country for
anything.</p>

<p>“And one evening I saw a moon in the sky. My daddy told me
it was a moon and surely he knows! And over the moon there was
a bright gold star, and I made a wish. This was my wish: that other
babies might have happy homes as I have, where they don’t want
to cry, because there is no reason to cry. I’m well looked after, I’m
never spoilt and they love me; so why should I cry? But what I’m
thinking about mostly, these days, is of how lucky I am to have such a
daddy and mother and to see the beautiful springtime in the country.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day96">APRIL 5: Brenda’s Easter Visit</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“Her name is Brenda,” said daddy, “and when I saw her
yesterday she told me that every year at Easter time she
went to the head nurse of the big hospital and found out the
names of all the children. Then she went shopping, and it took her
a long time to pick out things for little sick children. She picked out
for each child a big round chocolate egg which rattled, for inside
it there were little sugar candies; also a chocolate chicken and a chocolate
bunny. She always picked out ones that had lots of expression
too. Around the egg she tied a big red ribbon, around the chocolate
chicken’s neck she tied a bright green ribbon, and around the bunny’s
neck she tied a bright purple ribbon. Then she put them in a little
box and wrote on the box the child’s name.</p>

<p>“Last year Brenda went to the hospital the day before Easter. It
was far from being a pleasant day. There was a cold wind in the air
and no sun.</p>

<p>“She arrived at the hospital just as all the little children had had their
wounds dressed. They were lying in their little white cots trying to
keep back the tears that wanted to come.</p>

<p>“Brenda asked the nurse if she could go inside with the gifts.</p>

<p>“‘Yes, indeed!’ said the nurse. ‘The children would love that.
The child’s name in the first cot,’ continued the nurse very softly, ‘is
Elsa. She has hurt her back, and no one knows how long she will
have to lie there.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span></p>

<p>“‘Elsa,’ said Brenda, ‘happy Easter. A little chocolate bunny, a
little chocolate chicken and a big chocolate egg all said they wanted
to wish you a happy Easter.’</p>

<p>“Elsa opened her half shut eyes and clutched the box. She opened
it eagerly. There they all were! And the chocolate bunny did have
the funniest expression! He would have made any one laugh, and
his purple ribbon bow was sticking way up on one side with such a saucy
expression. Elsa burst out laughing. Afterward the nurse told Brenda
it was the first time she’d seen Elsa laugh since she’d been brought to
the hospital.</p>

<p>“Then Brenda took the rest of her boxes around to all the other
little sick children. And such happiness as there was in the ward!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day97">APRIL 6: An Uninvited Guest</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">The children were just finishing their lunches which they had
been eating in the school yard and were going back to their
classes when what should they see but a bear!</p>

<p>“Oh, oh, hurry, scurry, run, run,” they all cried.</p>

<p>“Oh, what an escape!” some of them panted, when they were safe
in a nice big barn down the road.</p>

<p>But the bear was having the time of his life.</p>

<p>“Well, well, well,” he growled, “I really don’t understand it at
all. Children come to the circus and gaze and gaze at us, and tell
their mothers and their daddies how nice they think we are. But how
they did run! And I had come to pay them a nice call.</p>

<p>“Sniff-sniff, what is it I smell?” continued the bear. And then he
jumped around for joy. “Goodies! Food! Wonderful, wonderful
food! How kind of the dear little children. They really expected
me to lunch—for they’ve left lots of food—and when I came they
didn’t want to make me uncomfortable by watching me eat.</p>

<p>“Ah, now, I have had a fine meal, a luxurious meal, fit for a king—no,
fit for a bear!” And the bear rubbed his front paw over his well-filled
tummy and again growled delightedly to himself some more,
saying over and over again: “Delicious; such a meal!”</p>

<p>But along came the keeper of the animals of the circus and led the
bear back to his cage. For a circus was traveling through the country
and when they had stopped for a rest this bear had escaped. But
what a tale he had to tell when he got back to the circus again!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day98">APRIL 7: The Tired Honeysuckle</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“I’m very tired,” said the Honeysuckle, “and I’d really almost
rather not come up this spring.”</p>

<p>“But you are supposed to come up every year,” said the Hyacinth.
“You are like me, my dear: your roots are good and lasting.
We don’t have to be replanted from seeds every spring.”</p>

<p>“Yes, what you say is perfectly true,” said the Honeysuckle. “But
then I am old, so very, very old.”</p>

<p>“How old are you?” whispered the Hyacinth in a very low voice
which the Wind carried on his shoulders.</p>

<p>“I am so many years old I can’t remember. This garden I’ve heard
people say has been kept just like this for over a hundred years, and
the house near-by is just as old—in fact, it is older. I’ve been here a
very large part of that time.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the Hyacinth, “then I don’t blame you for feeling
tired. I should think you would want to rest. Let them start another
Honeysuckle growing. You’ve worked hard enough.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” said the Honeysuckle, “that’s just what you don’t understand.
I am tired, very tired. But ah, I must blossom because of the people.”</p>

<p>“What people?” asked the Hyacinth.</p>

<p>“The people in this house. You see, I am just outside a window,
growing on my vine, and my sweet fragrance can be carried indoors.
Of course yours can, too, dear old Hyacinth, though you aren’t so
old, are you? But I last all through the summer, and you are just a
glorious spring flower.”</p>

<p>“Then it’s no wonder you get tired out. And you have to give
the bumblebees honey. Your honey is very fine, I have heard.”</p>

<p>“And don’t forget the humming-birds,” said the Honeysuckle.
“They love me every bit as much as the bumblebees do. And I love
them too! The little dears! But I must tell you the reason why I
come up each year, even though sometimes it seems so hard.</p>

<p>“Years and years ago I was planted by a little girl—a little girl,
Mary Alice, who loved flowers and who could always make them
grow. And above all the flowers she loved her red Honeysuckle best
of all. She watched over me. She gave me drinks. She dug up
the earth around my roots. She made me so comfortable. And for
a very special occasion she would pluck off a spray of my red blossoms
and wear them.</p>

<p>“Now Mary Alice grew up to be a big lady—though she was never
very big. She always seemed like a little girl to me, for she was so
dainty, so small and so lovely. Her eyes were very blue and her hair
very golden. But as the years went by each spring I noticed that silver<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
was growing in her hair, and then one spring I saw that it was quite
white.</p>

<p>“During all this time there were other little children growing up—and
now there are some more. And I always saw my little girl—for
I thought of her as that even when she was quite, quite old—smiling
at all the little faces, and the children would smile at her—never
scowls—always smiles. Somehow no one could have scowled at Mary
Alice, and I don’t believe she ever scowled at any one. For when her
hair was white, her forehead had no wrinkles.</p>

<p>“Every spring she would be waiting for me. ‘There comes my
honeysuckle,’ she would say. The last few years it has been very hard
to come up. My roots have lost their strength, but I have come
along as best I could, for I have thought of Mary Alice and her smiles.</p>

<p>“Last year she was sitting by her window and looking out at me.
‘That honeysuckle is as old as I am,’ she said.</p>

<p>“And not long after that I missed seeing dear little old-young
Mary Alice and her smiles when I wafted my fragrance through her
window.</p>

<p>“But one day I saw the other people of the house and the children,
too, looking at me. ‘The honeysuckle that she loved,’ they said. ‘Oh
we hope it will keep on coming up each year, for it reminds us so of
her. But it looks pretty old now.’</p>

<p>“So you see, little Hyacinth, I must come up, even though I am so
very tired and old!”</p>

flowers.</p>

<p>“We’d like to hear a story,” the fairies said.</p>

<p>“You see,” said the white lilac bush, “we are all a part of the great
Flower Parade. When the snow leaves the ground the crocus flowers
appear and take the lead in the parade. They are like the drum-major
who leads the procession, but instead of tossing a fancy stick
into the air, they lift up their little heads and tell the world that spring
has come.</p>

<p>“Next follow the hyacinths, the tulips, daffodils, narcissus flowers,
garden violets, pansies, and little daisies. They all are about in the
same part of the parade. And when they come we appear too, as well
as the flowering almond shrubs and many others.</p>

<p>“But the pansies, little daisies and garden violets blossom all through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
the season, so they’re like the small boys who run along by the side
of the parade—almost anywhere, at any time.</p>

<p>“And after we go the flowers will still keep on parading. The lilies-of-the-valley
are marching now, and soon the dear forget-me-nots with
their blue, blue eyes will come.</p>

<p>“The rockets, peonies, honeysuckles and roses all will follow along,
making a very handsome part of the parade. And later on the phlox,
larkspur so blue, and foxglove will follow.</p>

<p>“These are the flowers that come up year after year and they are
the ones which belong to the great Flower Parade. It takes a whole
spring and summer and early autumn to see the whole parade. But it’s
worth seeing, and though we can’t be here all the time, we’re glad
for our part of the parade—we are.”</p>

of gorgeous garden flowers would continue all summer.</p>

<p>“After many bands had gone by, many soldiers, and many
sailors, a wagon drawn by four big horses came along, and upon the
wagon was an enormous cage. In this cage were homing pigeons.</p>

<p>“On the side of the wagon was written a little story about the
pigeons, telling how they had taken messages through all sorts of
dangers, how brave they had been, how clever, and how they had
thought of their duty and not of themselves.</p>

<p>“And when that wagon passed along carrying the homing pigeons
every one clapped, for here were little dumb creatures who had shown
a wonderful understanding and had done all they could for the country,
and the little pigeons were so modest that they actually wondered
what all this excitement was about!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day101">APRIL 10: The Alphabet Letters</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“My story is a very sad and sorrowful one. If I tell it to
you it will make you cry,” said the letter Z.</p>

<p>“Alphabet letters don’t cry,” said the letter S. “Tears
are shed over us, but we don’t cry ourselves. So tell us your sad and
sorrowful story, Mr. Z.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span></p>

<p>“Tell us the sad and sorrowful story,” repeated the other alphabet
letters.</p>

<p>“It shows I have a good disposition,” said the letter Z. “I’m neither
angry nor cross.”</p>

<p>“There, there,” said the letter S. “You used me twice in that last
word, which was all very well, but you need not have brought in that
word angry, for angry and cross mean the same.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said the letter Z. “I do so little work these days that
I really feel as if I didn’t know anything.”</p>

<p>“Poor letter Z,” the other letters all said.</p>

<p>“Tell us your story,” said the letter S.</p>

<p>“I will,” agreed the letter Z.</p>

<p>“Pray do,” the others urged.</p>

<p>“It’s the letter S which has caused the trouble,” said the letter Z.</p>

<p>The letter S wiggled and wriggled and twisted and turned and
said:</p>

<p>“I beg you pardon, letter Z. I am sure I have meant no harm.”</p>

<p>“None at all,” said the letter Z. “I know you have meant no harm.
And you needn’t beg my pardon, for it isn’t your fault. You can’t
rule teachers and parents and writers and students. You do what you
can for them, that is all.</p>

<p>“But think about it, letters, and you will understand. Just think
of the number of words which used to need my letter in them and
now they have put the letter S in instead.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the letter M, “that is true, and we can think about these
things now, for it is recess time.”</p>

<p>“Think of all the words which end with the letters ‘ise.’ They used
to end with the letters ‘ize.’”</p>

<p>“True,” said the alphabet letters; “perfectly true.”</p>

<p>“You’re sure you are not angry with me?” asked the letter S, wriggling
nervously.</p>

<p>“Quite true,” said the letter Z. “As I said before, it is not your
fault. But isn’t my tale a sad and sorrowful one?”</p>

<p>“It is,” said the other letters.</p>

<p>But just then up spoke the letter S and the letter I and the letter E.</p>

<p>“Letter Z,” they said, “come and join us or we won’t be a word.
We need you, letter Z; we must have you.”</p>

<p>So the letter Z joined these three letters and they all jumped around as
the word SIZE appeared, as you have doubtless already guessed.</p>

<p>“You’re all very good to me,” said the letter Z as it played around
with the letters S and I and E. Each one kept its own place in the
word, but sometimes they made themselves look very big and sometimes
they made themselves look very small and sometimes they made
themselves look just about medium size. For, as they made up the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
word size, and as size can be small—small size, you know—or big, they
did everything they could and played all the games they could.</p>

<p>Then other letters formed other words and they played around,
just as they should have played to show folks what they meant. You
can imagine what a wonderful time the letters F and U and N had.</p>

<p>“Hurry, hurry,” said the letter S. “All the big S letters and all
the little S letters. Hurry now to the class rooms.”</p>

<p>“I don’t have to hurry much,” said the letter Z, “but I will either live
to a very old age from being lazy and doing nothing to tire myself,
or else I’ll be forgotten entirely.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, you won’t be forgotten,” said the other alphabet letters.</p>

<p>“We’ll see to that,” said the letters A and B and C. “We have a
great deal to do with schools and lessons, you know, and we will
keep you with us, never fear.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, thank you,” said the letter Z, as it twisted itself slowly
back into the school rooms.</p>

<p>And the letter S said: “Thank you for not being angry with me.
You’re a good sport, letter Z.”</p>

and bits of cloth and strings and bits of twigs. In fact, he is
very good natured.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Scissor-Tailed Flycatcher has a happy time with such a pleasant
mate and she is pleasant herself which makes them both happy.</p>

<p>“The event of her life is hatching time. When she is sitting on
four whitish-brown eggs which will soon be little scissor-tailed flycatchers
she is as happy as a bird can be, and that is pretty happy, as
you can imagine.</p>

<p>“I am going to tell you now about Mr. Scissor-Tailed Flycatcher and
his talk to an insect.</p>

<p>“‘Little insect,’ said Mr. Scissor-Tailed Flycatcher, ‘I am very well
named. I am called a flycatcher and I catch flies. But I don’t only
catch flies. I catch other insects as well.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day103">APRIL 12: The Woodpecker Band</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“Come on, come on, join the band! Rehearsals to begin this
morning! Get in practise! Lose no time! We’re ready,
and we hope you’ll be ready too. First practise to start in
half an hour.”</p>

<p>Now the woodpeckers were the ones who had been talking. They
were already starting to practise by drumming on the bark of the trees.
The trees are the drums and the woodpeckers all beat the drums. Of
course a great deal of the time they work hard at the trees, burrowing
for insects, and they help to destroy many bad ones.</p>

<p>But some time before Mr. Hairy Woodpecker had suggested they
should start a band. The drums were played by Mr. Hairy Woodpecker,
Mr. Red-Headed Woodpecker, Mr. Downy Woodpecker, Mr.
Sapsucker, Mr. Crested Woodpecker and Mr. Flicker Woodpecker.</p>

<p>Those who sang and helped along the chorus and played little mouth-organs
and various instruments made out of twigs were the warblers,
the vireos, goldfinches, mocking-birds, bobolinks, chickadees, pewees,
phoebes, orioles, thrushes, song-sparrows and whippoorwills. And of
course, almost the most important of all were the robins!</p>

<p>Mr. Robin Redbreast was the leader of the band. He waved a little
stick in front of the band-stand, which was up in a tree.</p>

<p>How they all did play and sing. Now in a great many bands, in fact
in most bands, they do not have singing, but in the woodpecker’s band
it is entirely different.</p>

<p>What would a band be like in birdland without singing? They
would miss all the beautiful songsters who would add so much music,
and that would be such a pity.</p>

<p>So the woodpeckers were wise indeed when they asked the song birds
to join in the band.</p>

<p>They practised all that day for the coming concert. And before
they went to bed that night and before they even thought of putting
their heads under their wings, they sent around notices to all the birds
to be on hand, and this is how the notices read: “First concert of the
season to be given by the Woodpeckers’ Band to-morrow at sunrise.
Mr. Robin Redbreast will conduct.”</p>

<p>The concert was a huge success and the people said, “It’s really and
truly the springtime when we have a concert such as we were given this
morning!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day104">APRIL 13: The Tease</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“Grace,” said daddy, “had a brother named Edward, and
Edward was a tease; not a nice, good-natured, funny sort
of a tease, but he was the kind who hurt people’s feelings.
He would see some one who had a suit on which was not new, or which
had been patched, and he would try to make the one who was wearing
it feel very uncomfortable.</p>

<p>“Edward would also see boys wearing their older brothers’ suits,
and he would say with a mean look: ‘Where did you get that suit?’</p>

<p>“And—he also liked to tease Grace by making fun of her doll Gracie
and by tossing her up in the air, and playing with her as though she
were a ball, and he could bat her in a game of his own mean making.</p>

<p>“Oh, how she would feel when Gracie was lifted up into Edward’s
hands, and then he would toss her up and say:</p>

<p>“‘What’s the difference? She’s only made of rags. Why do you
care? Gracie doesn’t.’ One day he left the doll high up in a tree out
in the yard, and Grace was afraid that more snow would come in the
night and that it would spoil her beloved Gracie, for there had been a
late snow-storm that day.</p>

<p>“But a boy, a friend of Edward’s, who didn’t think Edward was
really much of a boy for teasing Grace in that horrid way, had found
Grace crying. He found out what the trouble was, and he got Gracie
from the high limb of the tree.</p>

<p>“Edward didn’t know that his friend had brought down the doll, and
at night when he slept, lo and behold, Gracie seemed to come and stand
at the end of his bed.</p>

<p>“But no longer was Gracie a little rag doll. She had grown, oh, she
had grown. And she was wearing instead of a painted wig, great
icicles which were so heavy and cold looking.</p>

<p>“Her body seemed very stiff and straight. It seemed very strong,
and as if she were made of steel or of iron instead of rags.</p>

<p>“‘Edward,’ she said, and her voice seemed harsh and terrible, ‘Edward,’
she continued, ‘you left me out in the snow to-night, so as to
tease your little sister. But now I will show you what it is like to be
abused. Even if you don’t actually hurt me, you hurt your sister who
loves me. Wait and I will show you.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, don’t,’ shrieked Edward. He was very cowardly when he
was going to be teased, you see. ‘I’ll be good. I promise,’ and his
voice sounded thoroughly frightened.</p>

<p>“‘I’ll have to show you first,’ said the doll. She took Edward in her
arms, which had grown so big and so hard, and she tossed him
up in the air and around and about, so that he was frightened any
moment he might land on the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span></p>

<p>“And Edward thought of the doll outside—he thought she still
was there, and oh, he was so sorry, but he never again made Grace
miserable by teasing Gracie.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day105">APRIL 14: The Onion’s Speech</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“The vegetables were talking in the cellar,” said daddy, “and
I must confess that they were boasting a great deal. But
still one can forgive a vegetable for boasting very often,
for if we lived so near the ground—or in the ground as they do—we’d
probably like to pretend we were higher up! The onion was now
talking. ‘I came from the Land of the Pyramids originally. My
ancient home was in Egypt, far, far across the water, in a wonderful,
ancient part of the world that is full of history and interest and beauty.’</p>

<p>“‘Hear! Hear!’ said all the other vegetables.</p>

<p>“‘I myself have never seen that far land,’ continued the onion, ‘but
my family came from there at first, way, way back where the family
tree first starts from.’</p>

<p>“‘How can you have a family tree when you’re an onion and not
even a branch?’ asked a very plain little potato.</p>

<p>“‘People,’ said the onion haughtily, ‘have family trees, and they
aren’t branches, nor are they leaves. Family trees mean ancestors,
noble grandfathers and aristocratic grandmothers, high-up great aunts,
and snobbish great uncles. A family tree is something every one and
everything can’t have. Now you, poor potato, haven’t a family tree
at all.’</p>

<p>“But the potato didn’t seem to mind in the least. However, the
onion went on talking. ‘Now my young friend, the radishes came first
from China—an interesting history has the Radish family. The
Horse-Chestnut family came from Asia, and the Mulberry trees from
Persia. The Cucumbers came from the East Indies, and the Spinach
family came first from Arabia.’</p>

<p>“‘How very fine,’ said the potato in a very sarcastic tone of voice.</p>

<p>“‘You’re right,’ said the onion, not noticing the sarcastic voice; ‘it’s
very fine to have a family tree. It’s something, as I said before,
that every one can’t have. You never came from afar, Mr. Potato.
And neither did the oats, corn, pumpkins and other plain creatures who
don’t know what aristocracy and grandeur mean.’</p>

<p>“‘What does it mean?’ asked the potato.</p>

<p>“‘You weren’t paying attention,’ said the onion. ‘It means a family
tree and noble grandparents.’</p>

<p>“‘Pooh!’ exclaimed the potato. ‘If a vegetable isn’t good itself it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
makes no difference where it came from nor what its grandparents
were. It’s what a vegetable is itself. Suppose I were a bad potato,
which I’m not, I’m thankful to say, would it make any difference because
my great-great-grandfather had come from some interesting land
across the sea? Not in the least. I’m a good useful vegetable and
can be cooked in many ways. That’s what counts in this world. To
amount to something yourself. Be a real vegetable! Do what you
can to nourish the world! Don’t boast!’</p>

<p>“The onion felt very badly. It had been so proud of its fine history,
and often it was unhappy because it was so unkindly talked about.</p>

<p>“‘I try to be good,’ said the onion. ‘I season things and I make
many good dishes. I do the best I can.’</p>

<p>“‘Of course you do, little onion,’ said the potato. ‘But next time
you make a speech, tell us all to do our best and not boast about
what others have done or have been.’</p>

<p>“And the onion always made speeches after that which were not
about family trees, and when it was finally cooked every one said:
‘What a nice onion must have been put in this soup.’”</p>

called ‘The Bookworm’ by people who don’t know much. I love
books, but I don’t care for reading. That might sound strange to
some folks, but the bookworm families know that being a bookworm
doesn’t mean reading words. Once I went through each page
of each book along on the shelf in just the very same spot, so that
they could have put a ribbon or a string or anything they might have
had near at hand through all those many holes and hung the books up instead
of standing them on the shelves. I thought they might care to
change the books a little, so I did my best to help. That certainly

<p>“Its foliage is something like that of the willow, drooping
and looking very dainty and lovely. Its bark is rich and
soft, but best of all, is the fruit which is used for making all sorts
of delicious goodies, especially wild cherry juice!</p>

<p>“Then medicines and tonics have been made from the fruit and
bark and roots of the wild black cherry.</p>

<p>“Cherry-wood is considered by many people to be almost as handsome
as rosewood and mahogany, and the old wild black cherry tree
is the tree which is used to make beautiful cherry-wood furniture.</p>

<p>“Its cousin, the wild cherry, is greatly enjoyed by birds who simply
love to eat the little fruits.</p>

<p>“Another cousin, the choke-cherry, is a tree filled with very bitter
fruit but the birds like the choke-cherry trees almost as well as any
other and flock about any they may find. The fashionable and rich

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“How do you feel?” asked the first apple blossom of a pear
blossom on one of the other trees in the orchard.</p>

<p>“Splendidly,” said the pear blossom. “How about yourself?”</p>

<p>“Never better,” said the apple blossom. Now when the other pear
blossoms and apple blossoms heard these two talking they all wanted
to see what was going on.</p>

<p>And before long they were all out talking and chatting while some
of them were having games with the Breeze Brothers who blew them to
the ground and made it look as if the snow had come again.</p>

<p>“Did your tree have a secret to whisper to you?” asked the first
apple blossom.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the first pear blossom. “I was just about to ask
you the same question.”</p>

<p>“It’s this way with us,” said the first apple blossom. “You see the
farmhouse is very shabby. It has been needing a coat of paint for so
many years. And the people who live inside are so poor they can’t
afford anything they don’t actually need.</p>

<p>“They feel badly that they cannot afford to have their house painted
for it would look so much brighter and prettier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span></p>

<p>“Well, it has been this same way for so many, many years, as I said
before. And they have had bad luck with the potatoes and the corn
every year. Something always happens. Bugs eat up the potatoes
and a storm is likely to come and hurt the corn just when it would be
growing quite perfect.</p>

<p>“All these things my tree whispered and said, ‘Little blossoms, all
of you must be beautiful so for one season in the year the people in the
farmhouse will think they have the loveliest of homes. Make their
dingy home look like a fairyland.’” And once again the blossoms
gave joy to the people in the dingy farmhouse, who every year had the
most beautiful place owing to the blossoms.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day109">APRIL 18: The Button Bag</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“In a work bag,” said daddy, “there lived a button bag. The
button bag was made of blue and white cambric, I believe you
call it, and it had a blue silk ribbon around it at the top—I suppose
a sort of neck-tie, one might say.</p>

<p>“At any rate, in this bag were loads and loads of buttons. The
button bag was a very large button bag, and the work bag was a
very large work bag.</p>

<p>“Whenever any one wanted a button, or whenever any one said
they had lost a button or that a button was off, the work bag was
taken out and then a button was found—always a button for everything
that needed a button.</p>

<p>“And when any member of the household wanted to do a little
mending, for everything that lacked a button there was always found
to be one.</p>

<p>“What did the buttons and the button bag have to say to all this?
Were they pleased they were so useful? We shall hear.</p>

<p>“‘When is the party going to be?’ asked the big, white button, with
the shining face.</p>

<p>“‘Pretty soon,’ said the little green button, ‘pretty soon.’</p>

<p>“‘I’ve been to lots of parties,’ said a button with a funny little
face, a face of some old, old knight or lord or something very noble!</p>

<p>“He had two sisters and a brother and the four of them were all
just alike. They had never been used, as nothing had ever come
up that needed their time and their presence. They had been in the
button bag for years. But, of course, they were kept, for there might
be a time, no one knows when or how soon, when the buttons with
the faces might be just the ones wanted.</p>

<p>“‘It’s so nice,’ said the one who had just spoken, ‘that we are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
always sure of a home. It’s so nice. Some would throw us away
and would say they had no use for a lot of old buttons taking up
room when they were about sure we’d never be used.</p>

<p>“‘But we don’t have to worry, for the mistress of the house who
owns the work bag and the button bag and all the buttons, always
says that we don’t eat or drink, meaning we don’t cost her any money,
and we might be useful some time.</p>

<p>“‘She’s a sensible lady, yes she is. And we’re sure of a home,
quite sure of one.</p>

<p>“‘But as I said I have been to a great many parties. Although I
have lived in the button bag such a long time, once I lived on a
handsome dress, oh, such a handsome dress, and then I went to great
balls and parties and all.’</p>

<p>“‘Ah,’ said a big black button, ‘I’ve had a nice life, too. I’ve
lived on fur coats. I’ve been on several, and I’ve been out on
glorious bracing winter days when the snow came in my face and
body all at once!</p>

<p>“‘I’ve been for sleigh-rides where bells jingled and where my button
heart leaped for joy!’</p>

<p>“‘And I,’ said a little brown button, ‘have on the other hand been
about in the summer. I belonged to a lovely bathing suit which belonged
to a little girl, and I used to see the sand made into castles and
bridges and rivers, and all sorts of marvelous things, and the lovely
ocean would go over me—oh, it was so cool and refreshing!</p>

<p>“‘And all about me were happy, smiling people. Every one was
shrieking with delight. If I had known how to shriek I would have
called at the top of my voice, if I had a voice:</p>

<p>“‘“Oh, the button is happy, too, the button is so happy!”’</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ said the tan button, ‘we must get ready for the party, as we
must frolic all night and then be back in our places by morning, so it
won’t confuse or mix any one up who may sew in the morning.’</p>

<p>“‘Right,’ said all the buttons.</p>

<p>“So they all borrowed old pieces of ribbon from the bag and little
pieces of thread, and they dressed themselves in fine array, and then
they danced and sang in their little button voices, which, of course,
aren’t real voices, but only make-believe ones. This was their song:</p>

<p class="dropcap">“I must thread my needle before I begin my work,” said a little

<p>“What’s that I hear?” asked one of the pine needles. “She
speaks about threading her needle? Am I her needle, or are you her
needle, or who in the world is her needle? And what is thread?”</p>

<p>The poor needles were very nervous. And the other little girl spoke
next: “I like to knit better than I do to sew because then I can use
four needles.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, oh dear,” said the pine needles. “There’s a child who
needs four needles. Do you suppose she threads us too?”</p>

<p>They watched for a long time, trying to move away from the children
so they would not be used. They whispered to the pine tree saying:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p class="dropcap">As I don’t think you will be able to guess right away and as I
want to tell you what really happened, I will tell you the place
Blackie the cat chose for his nap one Sunday.</p>

<p>It was in the church organ! Well, he had a fine sleep. And he was
still asleep when the organist came in and began to play.</p>

<p>Then poor Blackie woke up with a start! At first he didn’t know
whether he was having a nightmare or a bad dream, or what was
happening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span></p>

<p>He moved to one side and the organ gave a curious rumble and a
very funny sound and the organist looked as if he didn’t know what
the trouble could be, and the people stopped singing and then tried
to go on singing without any music.</p>

<p>The organist tried to play again and this awfully queer rumble and
burr and buzz was heard once more. So the people went on finishing
their singing without any organ.</p>

<p>Of course Blackie tried to move when he felt the pedals moving and
he jumped over the inside stops and pedals and made these very strange
sounds as he did so.</p>

<p>The organist looked inside the organ and saw nothing. Then, suddenly,
he saw two big green eyes staring at him.</p>

<p>“It’s a cat in there,” he said to himself.</p>

<p>Poor Blackie was very much frightened. This was altogether too
much. He liked adventures and he liked to explore but this was going
too far.</p>

<p>“Yes, that is a cat,” said the organist to himself, and Blackie’s green
eyes shone back at him when he said this.</p>

<p>“Come, pussy; come, nice pussy,” said the organist in a whisper.
Poor Blackie was so frightened he did not know what to do. Still the
organist kept on coaxing and begging Blackie to come out. And after
a while Blackie felt less frightened and the soft whisper of the organist
sounded very kind and Blackie came out from inside of the church organ.</p>

<p>Oh, how happy he was when he was out and the organist got a little

a collection of cocoons. He keeps them on little twigs in a
great big box punched full of holes.</p>

come out he never kills them or tries to keep them, for he thinks that
is dreadfully cruel. He knows well that they love to see the sun and
be out in the fresh air among the flowers, and he wouldn’t deprive them
of that pleasure for anything.</p>

<p class="dropcap">“I’d like to know,” said Fairy Ybab, of a magnificent tree which
was one mass of huge blossoms, “why you are called the Horse-Chestnut
tree? You aren’t eaten by horses, are you? You
don’t look like a horse.”</p>

<p>The Horse-Chestnut gave a funny low, whispering laugh.</p>

<p>“I will explain,” said the Horse-Chestnut. “You see, there are some
creatures who have engagements all the time. They have to meet a
friend at such and such a time or they have to be back for dinner at
such a time or they must be in bed at such another time.</p>

<p>“Now, the trees are different. We haven’t any engagements like
that. We trees don’t have to go anywhere at all. In fact, we can’t
go anywhere. We’re perfectly satisfied, too.</p>

<p>“You’ve never heard of a tree pulling itself up by the roots and crying
out in a hoarse, leafy way:</p>

<p>“‘Dear me, I do want to go to a birthday party.’</p>

<p>“In the first place of all I am called a Horse-Chestnut tree because I
have marks between my leaves and twigs which look like horseshoes
with nails in them.</p>

<p>“That is the answer to the first question. And the answer to the
second question is this: No, I am not eaten by horses. My nuts are
much too bitter. Children like to play with them, for they’re big and
handsome, but they’re not good to eat.</p>

<p>“It eats some of the shell from which it came. It’s a little like
moving out of a house and before leaving it entirely, eating it up!</p>

<p>“Then the caterpillar becomes a chrysalis and soon a butterfly. It’s
a happy day for the caterpillar when it becomes a beautiful butterfly.
No longer will people call it a horrid caterpillar. They will say, ‘Look
at the beautiful butterfly!’</p>

<p>“And as the butterfly sips from the little flowers and enters right
into the hearts of many of them, it whispers:</p>

<p>“‘I’ve been a long time coming to you, flower, but the hard crawling
journey had a wonderful ending.’</p>

<p>“And though the flower does not altogether understand, it partly
does, for it whispers: ‘Eat all of my honey and sip my sweetness,

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“I heard something far from pleasant about you, little Tack,”
said the big Nail.</p>

<p>There were many other tacks in the box, but there were also
many nails. They were all together in one big white box, and whichever
size was wanted could be picked from the lot.</p>

<p>But the Nail which was the biggest of all, or about the biggest, was
talking to the Tack which was about the smallest of all the tacks in
this big box.</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose you want me to ask you what it is,” said the Tack,
moving a little in the box.</p>

<p>“You needn’t ask me if you don’t want to,” said the Nail haughtily.</p>

<p>“But of course I want to; that is only natural,” said the Tack.</p>

<p>“I thought you would want to,” said the Nail, in a hard, metallic
voice. Now a metallic voice is a voice which sounds as hard and cold
as any metal could be. Of course that was the natural sort of voice
for a nail to have—still it was not a very cheerful voice to hear.</p>

<p>“The Master said that he had kept forgetting things all day long.
And then he said that he had a head like a tack.”</p>

<p>“Well, what of it?” asked the Tack. “Is that all?”</p>

<p>“That’s all, little Tack,” said the Nail. “Isn’t that enough?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think that was so dreadful,” said the Tack.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you don’t understand,” said the Nail.</p>

<p>“Perhaps not,” the Tack agreed.</p>

<p>“I’d better make sure you understand and so I will tell you. The
Master meant that his head was so small and stupid that he couldn’t
remember anything, and when he said that his family told him he
mustn’t talk so about himself. There, little Tack, you see you have
a little stupid head. No head at all, and because it’s such a poor
head they’ve made that sad saying about it. There was never such
a thing said of a Nail.”</p>

<p>“Maybe not,” said the Tack angrily, “but I can hang just as many
pictures as you can. Maybe you are used for big pictures but I am
used for small ones—nice little favorites, photographs and so forth.
I’m just as useful in my way. Just as useful,” the Tack repeated.</p>

<p>“But what is more,” the Tack continued, “I have very little use for
you in saying such a thing. You are supposed to be a friend of mine.
A nail is a sort of relation of a tack. I don’t blame the people for
saying such things. In their opinion my head is very small, and quite
rightly too, and I have not the things they call brains—neither have you.
So I don’t blame them in the least.</p>

<p>“But I blame you, Nail, for coming and telling me something to make
me unhappy. It’s not doing me any good. I can’t change my head.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
You’re just like a creature who wants to be praised because you didn’t
say the mean thing yourself; but you did worse than that—you repeated
it. Bah!” The Tack moved away disgusted, and the Nail moved
far to one side of the box, feeling much ashamed.</p>

be yourself to-night. Won’t you tell us the trouble?”</p>

<p>“I heard you say that once in a blue moon, you liked to have a banquet,
and I thought perhaps you knew of another moon, and wanted
him to shine for you. I’m not blue—that is I’m not really blue, though
now I do feel blue, blue and very sad.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Moon,” said the Fairy Queen, “I am so glad you told
me what the trouble was, for if you hadn’t told me we might have had
a very sad misunderstanding.</p>

<p>“Of course we didn’t want another moon, and there is no other
moon but you, dear Mr. Moon.</p>

<p>“When people say, ‘Once in a blue moon,’ they mean ‘Once in a
great while.’ They don’t mean that they want a blue moon, and can
only give such a party when there is a blue moon, or whatever they
are planning to give or do.</p>

<p>“Now we are going to have a banquet, and I meant that I
thought it was nice to have a banquet once in a great while. That was
a silly saying I used, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“I’m so relieved,” said Mr. Moon, smiling once more. “I never
heard of another moon, but of course how was I to be sure? Such
wonderful things happen all the time. People fly up in the air in
airships, and behave just like birds. So I wasn’t sure whether there
was another moon or not, and thought perhaps this fellow was blue,
being blue in color and feeling blue in spirits are different—eh?”</p>

<p>“Quite different,” said the Fairy Queen. “You don’t feel blue now,
do you?” And as the moon grinned happily the Fairy Queen knew
that everything was all right, and a banquet took place in Fairyland that
night.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Marion had a little shady flower bed. Every spring at
just about this time she would go into the woods with a
trowel and basket and pick out the loveliest ferns. These
she would carry home in her basket. Then in the shady afternoon
she would go to her fernery with a watering pot. First she would
dig a little hole, then she would put some water in it to see that
the roots of the fern got plenty of moisture, for that is what ferns love.
Then she would put the root of the fern in the hole and put soft earth
firmly around it. After she had planted her ferns she watered them
some more, for she was very careful that her ferns should be planted
just right, and that is why she had such good luck with them.</p>

<p>Every spring she would add to her fernery, and the ferns that she
had planted the year before came up more beautifully than ever.</p>

<p>She would get interesting looking rocks and stones and put them
between ferns here and there in the little fernery. It was very
delightful to see the plants come up in the spring and then go to the
woods and get some more beautiful ones. She was very particular,
you may be sure, to get nice young ones, for they are the best to
transplant.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“There was once a little fairy, who was named Fairy Sunrise,
because every morning she got up just at the same time
as Mr. Sun did.</p>

<p>“She had a great love for nice little pigs, as she thought they were
very cunning, and not at all the horrid little creatures some people think
they are.</p>

<p>“But one little pig worried her a great deal. He put on airs and
was very proud of himself. The little pig’s name was ‘Gink,’ and he
was the pet pig of a little girl who lived on a farm.</p>

<p>“Gink had overheard some city people who had visited the farm talk
about their figures. For a long time he couldn’t imagine what they
meant. Then, after listening for some time, he heard one of them say
that it was quite all right to eat everything any one wanted to, but
every one must exercise, walk and play games so as not to grow fat—for
it was so ugly to be fat!</p>

<p>“Gink had never thought it was ugly to be fat, but then that was
because he had never really thought about it at all. And yet when he
did think about it, he decided that he would much rather keep just
‘plump’ as he now was than grow as fat as his mother was. For he
said that his mother was a little bit old fashioned, and he wanted to
be a very modern pig.</p>

<p>“The next day he went for a walk. He went through the little
village, just managing to escape from under horses’ feet, and the little
boys’ bicycles. He went as far as the lake, where he saw some boys
starting off on a camping trip.</p>

<p>“‘Don’t you want to come with us?’ asked one of the boys.</p>

<p>“The little pig was just about to start off, thinking in his vain way
that the trip would do him good, when he heard a second boy say:</p>

<p>“‘Won’t he make wonderful bacon?’</p>

<p>“Then you should have seen little Gink run home to his mistress.
And after that awful fright and narrow escape, Gink stayed on the
farm outside the village, and decided fashions were very silly, and apt
to be dangerous. He also lost his love of walking!</p>

<p>“And little Fairy Sunrise who had been around just in time to whisper
to the little boy (though of course he didn’t see her) the word ‘bacon’
which had frightened Gink so much, was delighted that all her schemes
had worked out so well, and that she had cured the vain Gink.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day124">MAY 3: The Fairy and the Kangaroo</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“I must tell you a story to-night,” commenced daddy, “of the
sick kangaroo in the Zoo.</p>

<p>“To tell the truth the kangaroo wasn’t sick at all. He
simply thought he was but he succeeded in making the keeper think so
too. This pleased the kangaroo as all he really wanted was to have
a fuss made over him.</p>

<p>“The strange thing about his illness was that the keeper couldn’t
imagine what was the matter with the kangaroo. He had a perfectly
good appetite for he couldn’t give up eating just to pretend he was sick,
for really and truly he knew he was just ‘pretending.’</p>

<p>“Now, this puzzled the keeper, but he thought there must be some
kangaroo sickness where the animal could still eat, and yet be far
from well.</p>

<p>“The keeper became so worried over the kangaroo’s strange sickness
that at night he would get up to see if the kangaroo was asleep. Every
time he went to look, the kangaroo was sound, sound asleep, breathing
very quietly. The keeper thought to himself that this must be a good
sign, for if he happened to be suffering from indigestion he would
certainly be moaning and having bad dreams. Finally the keeper decided
the kangaroo must have heart failure.</p>

<p>“The next day the keeper sent for the doctor and the doctor examined
the kangaroo’s heart. He said that it was one of the strongest
hearts that he had ever examined. And the keeper was still more
puzzled.</p>

<p>“The kangaroo used to sit for hours and hours just playing with his
tail. Sometimes he would think it was time to show how badly he
felt by crying. So he would first look as if he just were able to keep
back the tears, and then he would act as if he could keep it up no longer
and would shake with sobs.</p>

<p>“Now this kangaroo had always been spoilt by his mother. When he
was very, very young he could always have everything he wanted, so
nothing was ever really a big treat.</p>

<p>“He always got sick at parties because he ate too much, and his
mother would never stop him, and on holidays he always was allowed
to turn things topsy-turvy. But one day when the animals were all to
be given a special treat, little Fairy Silver Wings, who had heard of
the kangaroo’s sickness, whispered to the other animals to leave him
behind to twist his tail and moan while they had their game of ball.</p>

<p>“Then the kangaroo set up a howling such as never had been heard
in animal land, for he didn’t want to miss a party—just as Fairy Silver
Wings had said; so when they all thought he had learned a good
lesson they went back for him. How ashamed he was when the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
animals at first snubbed him, but he never made a fuss again, for he
had had a great fright that he was going to miss a party through his
foolishness.”</p>

you about. Their names were Clover and Pinky. Clover
loved to hear her name. She loved to be called by it very
often and she liked it best of all when her name was made very real
by getting a lot of clover to eat.</p>

<p>“The other rabbit’s name was Pinky. Pinky was so named because
of his very bright pink eyes. They were really beautiful pink eyes.
Clover had pink eyes, too, but they were not so bright; they were a
little bit paler in shade than Pinky’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Pinky thought they were very fairly named, for, of course, Clover<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
should have the better name of the two, because Clover was
Mrs. Rabbit and it was polite and nice to give the lady the nicer name.</p>

<p>“Both the rabbits were white without a touch of black. They were
very fond of each other, they were very tame and fond of children and
they were extremely fond of all the nice green things they were given to
eat.</p>

<p>“Now the children who owned these rabbits didn’t know that daddy
rabbits were all right when their children were big but that when their
children were small they weren’t so nice because they were apt to kill
them.</p>

<p>“The daddies didn’t care for their babies when they were only little
bits of fluff. They didn’t see that they would grow up into nice rabbits
later on.</p>

<p>“So these two rabbits, Pinky and Clover, were not separated, and
Clover, somehow, wasn’t as afraid of Pinky as sometimes a mother
rabbit is.</p>

<p>“That is, a mother rabbit is never afraid of a daddy rabbit for herself,
for she knows he will never hurt her, but she is afraid for her
little ones.</p>

<p>“So when she knows that the little ones are soon to come she hides
away from the daddy rabbit.</p>

<p>“Clover wasn’t at all nervous. She saw that the children didn’t
know that they should be separated. And she somehow thought Pinky
would act very nicely about the little ones.</p>

<p>“She made a little hole in the ground and soon there came seven of
the sweetest, most cunning little bits of white fluff you ever did see!</p>

<p>“She had quite a hard time naming so many little babies but at last
she named them and these were the names she decided upon.</p>

<p>“Her eldest son was named Bun. Her eldest daughter was named
Bunny. Her second son was named Pink after his dad, and the
second daughter was named Cloverine after herself. The third son
was named Spot, because of a little black spot which he had on his
nose, and the third daughter was named Rabbity, while the fourth son
was named Baby Bun.</p>

<p>“And do you know that Pinky never touched one of those children
so as to hurt them? He didn’t kill them, he didn’t bite them.</p>

<p>“But instead he watched Mother Rabbit taking care of them, he
saw her giving them their meals. He watched her as she taught them
the lessons all rabbits must know.</p>

<p>“And he saw the children pick them up and handle them very gently
and kiss them and say how precious they were.</p>

<p>“After they grew up into bigger rabbits some of them were given
away and became the pets of other children and Clover and Pinky were
together again once more without the young ones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span></p>

<p>“‘I miss them,’ said Clover, ‘but I know that children will be good
to their rabbit pets, for I have always been treated so kindly and
nicely by children.’</p>

<p>“‘So have I,’ said Pinky.</p>

<p>“And the rabbits sniffed and their little noses wiggled and trembled
as they told each other what a nice world it was with children and
clover both in it!”</p>

the feathers of birds such as the herons or the birds of paradise or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
any other feathers where the birds have to be killed. We’ll wear

being cruel to little creatures like birds, and I’m going to start a boys’

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day129">MAY 8: Bossy White’s Escape</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“A little girl named Betty,” said daddy, “once had a pet
cow. Now, that may seem a very strange pet to have;
but, after all, the cow was a very nice pet, for every morning
and every evening she gave Betty delicious warm milk. Betty
always milked her own bossy herself and would carry into the house
twice a day a bucket of milk. But before she did that she always had
to drink a little first, so the cow would be pleased and would look at
her softly out of her great big eyes. Betty called her cow Bossy White,
for the cow had a round white spot above her right eye.</p>

<p>“During the daytime Bossy White stayed in the pasture, and at night-time
she came in to a warm, comfortable stall in the barn.</p>

<p>“Betty’s home was very near a swamp, where a great many black
racer snakes lived. But as the pasture had a wire fence all around it
nobody was afraid the snakes could get inside. The black racer
snakes adore chasing cows and try their hardest to catch them. Often
they succeed.</p>

<p>“Nobody had noticed it, but a piece of wire had really broken in a
part of the fence, and one of the black racer snakes got in.</p>

<p>“‘Now,’ said the snake to himself, ‘I shall have lots of fun chasing
this cow.’ So he began to hurry through the grass, and poor Bossy
White ran for all she was worth, almost frightened out of her wits.</p>

<p>“A little boy passing by saw the cow running and the grass moving,
so he knew that a black racer snake was chasing the cow. He jumped
over the fence and called: ‘Bossy White!’ (for he had often heard Betty
call her). ‘Come, Bossy White; follow me!’ And he led a wild chase,
running first to one side and then to the other until they reached the
barn in safety. You see, with the cow following the little boy’s crooked
route, the snake could not keep up, but got way behind, for the black<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
racer snakes lose so much time in going from side to side that that is
the way to escape them.</p>

<p>“When the little boy and the cow reached the barn there was Betty
waiting to milk Bossy White. She couldn’t understand why Bossy
White rushed into the barn nor why the little boy was so breathless.</p>

<p>“As soon as the little boy got his breath, though, he told Betty what
had happened. You can imagine how happy Betty was to feel that her
beloved Bossy White had been saved, and she told the little boy how
grateful she was to him. She also said, ‘Now I know how grateful
Bossy White feels, and I’m sure she’d like to give you a bucketful of
her delicious milk.’ So the little boy, who was very poor and who had
an invalid mother, took home his reward of a bucketful of delicious
milk.</p>

<p>“A doubly strong wire fence was put around the pasture, so that
Bossy White never again was chased by a black racer snake.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day130">MAY 9: The Spring Snow-storm</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“Well,” said the great big stone, “this is fine.”
The big stone was big enough so that quite a number of
children could get on it at one time. It was away off in
the woods, quite far from the nearest village, and it was a fine place to
have a picnic.</p>

<p>Some children had decided to give a picnic there and they had
asked their daddy to let them have two of the horses and the wagon to
take them all to the big stone.</p>

<p>The stone was in some woods which belonged to a family in a neighboring
farmhouse. They were not very well off, so they made a little
money by charging people who wanted to go through their land a small
amount to see the stone and have a picnic there.</p>

<p>And the most important thing about the stone has not yet been told.
It was a rocky stone. Yes, that great big stone actually rocked when
one touched it, just as a rocking-chair will rock.</p>

<p>All the children who were going to the picnic, went in the wagon
and there were five children in all.</p>

<p>They reached the road which was a private one, and they stopped to
pay to be allowed to go through to the part where the rocking stone was.</p>

<p>“How much is it?” they asked of the neighboring farmer’s little boy.</p>

<p>“It’s five cents apiece for children,” he said. “And that lets you
look at the stone and stay there as long as you want.”</p>

<p>“How much will it cost to let the team go through?” the children
asked, for they thought it would cost more with the wagon and horses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span></p>

<p>The little boy thought for a moment and then he said: “There
won’t be any charge for them, because I don’t suppose they will look at
the stone much!”</p>

<p>They all laughed, and the children went through to the rocking stone.
And it was then the stone said to itself: “This is fine.” How wonderful
it seemed! The stone was so big that they had to climb up a ladder
in order to reach the top where they were going to have their picnic,
and yet they could stand by it and move it so it actually rocked, not
using more than one hand.</p>

<p>“Let’s eat right away,” some one suggested.</p>

<p>And it was such a good suggestion that they started in to eat at
once. And such good things as they had! They had cocoa which was
piping hot, because it had been heated in a kettle on a bonfire which
they had made as soon as they had arrived.</p>

<p>They had sandwiches of all kinds, and cakes and bananas and oranges
and all sorts of other goodies. And they had a box with hard candies
in it which they all had decided was the best kind.</p>

<p>They had not been eating long when one of the children said:
“I do believe I feel a drop of rain—no—it is a flake of snow. Yes, it
is snowing!”</p>

<p>“It can’t be,” the other children said, “for the spring has come.”</p>

<p>“But look, there are really snowflakes falling now. And such great
big flakes, too!”</p>

<p>And, true enough, even though it was rather far north and though the
spring had come, huge snowflakes fell upon the children as they ate their
picnic lunch on top of the big rocking stone.</p>

<p>And they laughed and said: “Well, this is a real picnic and everything
is very wonderful.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said another child, “and it is so interesting as everything is a
little different from usual. It is not usual to have a picnic on top of
a huge stone upon which we have to climb by a ladder if we want to
reach the top, and yet which will rock when we touch it, just as though
it were a rocking chair. And now the snow is falling though it is
spring.”</p>

<p>The jolly old King Snow laughed as he heard this and said: “I like
to give them a surprise in the spring when they think I’ve left them for
good. And I’m glad I’ve given the children a good surprise, for it
makes their picnic party all the more fun, for they like me, they do.”
And old King Snow chuckled and went to bed for the summer months
feeling very happy indeed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day131">MAY 10: A Reward for Mr. Walrus</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“This Winter,” said daddy, “a Walrus was the Iceman in a
Zoo.</p>

<p>“It was this way. The Keeper had noticed that whenever
the Walrus’ pond became frozen over on cold, cold nights he was
just as happy as happy could be. He would chop up the ice with his
sharp tusks—for the Walrus has his ice pick always with him! Then he
would leave a clear, open space and down he would dive into his pond
and have a lovely icy swim.</p>

<p>“The Walrus loved it nice and cold—and how he did love the cold
water.</p>

<p>“Of course, at first, he simply chopped up the ice because he loved
the feeling of working with such a cold substance as ice. But his main
object was to get under the water and have a good cold bath.</p>

<p>“When the Keeper noticed that that was what the Walrus seemed to
want more than anything, he had the regular Iceman of the Zoo pick
up the pieces of ice as fast as the Walrus would break them up.
These would go into the Zoo ice-house all ready for the hot days of the
Summer.</p>

<p>“When the Walrus saw that he was doing some real work, and that
as soon as he chopped up the ice it was taken away, he was delighted.
For, you see, he was very fond of his good, kind Keeper, and he thought
it a fine thing to be a regular business Man—or a business Walrus—and
work hard each day. He enjoyed his swims more and more because he
felt he was doing some daily work.</p>

<p>“And the Keeper was delighted and said many very kind and flattering
things to the Walrus, which pleased him more than I can tell you.</p>

<p>“But alas! All too soon for Mr. Walrus came the warm spring days.
The Keeper could not think of anything else for Mr. Walrus to do, and
Mr. Walrus felt very sad that all the ice had gone away and that he
couldn’t chop any more.</p>

<p>“The Keeper really felt very badly that he had let Mr. Walrus do
so much work and had nothing now for him to do. But the Queen of
the Fairies came along and whispered to the Keeper a fine scheme as a
reward for Mr. Walrus—she whispered this when the Keeper was
thinking very hard one day about the Walrus.</p>

<p>“This is what she whispered to him.</p>

<p>“‘Mr. Keeper, go to the ice-house every day and pick out a nice big
piece of ice for Mr. Walrus. Then have it carried over to his pond,
and when you give it to him tell him it is his reward for working so hard
all Winter, and it is to cool his water—not to chop up.’</p>

<p>“Well, the Keeper did as the Fairy Queen had suggested. At first
the Walrus did chop up the ice—although it was such a small piece<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
to chop up he did seem a little surprised when it was put in his
pond. Then he waited for it to be taken away, but instead, the Keeper
came and told him to play with it himself.</p>

<p>“After a few days the Walrus understood it was all for him because
it was some of the ice he had chopped in the Winter.</p>

<p>“So every day when the ice would come he would be so joyful. He
would take a rest on the piece of ice first—for he thought it a lovely,
cool sort of chair—and then he would dive down into the cold water.
And the Fairy Queen was so pleased that the Walrus was getting
a good reward for his Winter’s work.”</p>

meals, for they practically lived on it. One day a big trunk was washed
ashore which without a doubt had fallen off one of the big boats passing

yellow satin dress, a green velvet coat, a hat with soft, big plumes on it,

was so excited—all those gorgeous things for a little girl who had
seen little else beside fishing-nets and such things.</p>

here in our fishing village, and you can have them to play with.’</p>

play I’m a queen when I wear that yellow satin dress and the velvet
coat, and I’ll pretend that the fishes are my subjects, and I can play I’m
a beautiful lady going to a ball when I wear the pink dress.’</p>

<p class="dropcap">“There was a little boy,” said daddy, “whose name was
Harry, and he loved sunsets and everything that had bright
colors. But as he had spent all his life in the city, he had not
seen half the wild flowers and lovely wood flowers you children can always
see.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span></p>

<p>“One day he had been playing very hard as it was his birthday and
his mother had given him a party. So he was tired before it was time
to go to bed, and he was sitting by the open window looking at the sun
just beginning to think about going to bed too.</p>

<p>“But the Fairy Queen was whispering to the sun to tell Harry a story
as a special birthday treat, and at the same time Harry was saying ‘Oh,
please go to bed, Mr. Sun, for I want to see all your bright colors.’</p>

<p>“But the sun had no intention of being hurried. He wanted to go
to bed when he was tired and not before. Besides, in the warm weather
he liked to stay up longer, and it was only in the cold winter that he
cared about going to bed before the afternoon really was over.</p>

<p>“In a moment or two Harry was sound asleep in his chair by the
window. And the sun had listened to the Fairy Queen’s whisper,
for soon Harry was having the most wonderful talk with Mr. Sun.</p>

<p>“He came right in the window, and sat on the sill, just as friendly
as friendly could be. He told Harry the history of his life, and oh,
how very, very old he was. It made Harry feel quite old too, to hear
the sun talking, and he said to him, ‘Mr. Sun, don’t you feel very blue
when you think how old you are?’</p>

<p>“‘Sometimes to be sure I do. That is only natural. And it is then
that you see many blue clouds and pale lavender colors around me as I’m
going to bed. But you will agree that isn’t very often. For when I am
sensible I say to myself that there is nothing disgraceful about being old.
And it is then that I look bright and rosy. For it is very foolish
to mind being old when you are as strong and well as I am and have
such a wonderful long record.’”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day134">MAY 13: Old Mr. Owl Writes a Book</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“Old Mr. Owl wanted to write a book and he asked the fairies
how to set about doing it,” commenced daddy.</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ said the fairy queen, ‘it makes a good deal of difference,
old Mr. Owl, what you want to write about.’</p>

<p>“‘What nonsense!’ he said. ‘It’s just that I want to know how to
start off with my book. Just think what a marvelous book it will be—for
as long as folks can remember I’ve been called the Wise Bird—the
bird who’s awake at night and whose eyes are so very bright!’</p>

<p>“‘Before I started saying what a fine book it would be, if I were
you, I’d write it and give other people the chance to say so,’ said the
fairy queen.</p>

<p>“Mr. Owl began to write with his pen, made out of one of Mr.
Turkey Gobbler’s best feathers, on a large, flat stone, which he put in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
the hollow of his tree. Very late in the night, he awakened his fairies
who had been sleeping, and told them to listen to his book. Then he
called all the owls from the neighborhood with a loud hoot-hoot. But
before he began to read, he said:</p>

<p>“‘I’ve not enough light. I will hurt my eyes—my beautiful, wise,
big eyes.’</p>

<p>“You see he had made a special arrangement to have his own lights,
and when he said that he hadn’t enough, from all over came countless
little fireflies. They sparkled and gave the most beautiful light all over
the woods, and Mr. Owl put his spectacles on his nose, and said:</p>

<p>“‘Now I see to perfection—which means quite all right.’ And Mr.
Owl commenced reading his book.</p>

<p>“It told about the parties, balls and picnics in fairyland, and of the
wild adventures and happenings in the woods. The fairies were absolutely
delighted that a book had been written with so much about them
in it.</p>

<p>“And the fairy queen was more than happy, for the last chapter was
all about her.</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ said Mr. Owl, ‘you made me ashamed of myself for boasting
about my book before I had written it, and so the only thing I
could do was to write a wise chapter all about you.’</p>

<p>“And the fairy queen smiled with pleasure and also with amusement—for
Mr. Owl had certainly thought he could write a wise book—though
the next time, perhaps, he wouldn’t say so before he had written
it.</p>

<p>“The fireflies had been sparkling and flashing lights all this time,
and finally they whispered:</p>

<p>“‘Have a dance, all of you; we’ll give you the light and dance too.
It is not well to read books all the time—you must dance.’</p>

<p>“So they all ended off with a fine dance, and old Mr. Owl, with his
book under his wing, danced with the rest of the owls and fairies.
But before the evening was over he presented to the fairy queen a copy
of his book, which said on the cover, ‘A BOOK, by Wise Mr. Owl.’”</p>

<p class="dropcap">“A little Boy named Billy was sitting in front of a fire,” began
daddy. “It was in his own bedroom and he was in a great
big armchair toasting his feet before he got into bed.</p>

<p>“He began thinking of the picture over the fireplace. It was a most
wonderful picture. There was a stage coach and a driver all dressed
in red. There were eight white horses with big red plumes standing
up from their harnesses, which made them look very fine indeed. And
then there were two footmen just climbing upon the coach. They never
seemed to reach the top; they always seemed to be in just the same
place trying to get there!</p>

<p>“Now Billy wondered if they didn’t get tired of being over the fireplace
all the time, hanging up on a silly hook. To him the eight beautiful
horses looked as if they needed a good gallop and run, and the little
fat coachman in red looked as if he would like to be off for a trip too.</p>

<p>“As Billy was wondering about it, suddenly he saw the coachman wave
his arms, flourish his whip and the two footmen jump—actually jump
right upon the top of the coach.</p>

<p>“And then the coach began to fill with passengers. The Fairy Queen
was there with all the little Fairies trailing along too. Billy didn’t
see how the coach could possibly hold so many passengers, but to his
great surprise it began to grow larger and larger. And soon he heard
a gruff voice.</p>

<p>“‘Well, Billy, do you want to see where we go when we take our
trips? You mustn’t think we stay over this fireplace all the time. We
have many friends, and we go upon wonderful trips when you’re
fast asleep. But this time we will take you with us.’</p>

<p>“Just then a little Gnome came down from the coach and began to
help Billy up.</p>

<p>“Off they went, with the most dashing and daring speed. Around
cliffs they tore, and over the narrowest and most dangerous roads.</p>

<p>“Finally they came to the very steepest cliff you can possibly imagine.</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ said the fat little coachman, ‘here we all get dashed to
pieces unless the Tipping Bird comes along.’</p>

<p>“‘Dear me,’ said Billy, ‘I do hope he comes. I would hate to be
dashed to pieces.’</p>

‘we won’t really be dashed to pieces. The Tipping Bird is a Bird
known only in Fairyland, and he always comes just as the Fairy Queen
waves her wand.’</p>

<p>“And soon what should Billy see come flying along but a great big
black Bird—the biggest Bird Billy had ever seen in all his life. They
left the coach on the side of the cliff, and then the horses, coachman,
footmen, Fairies, Gnomes, Billy and all, found nice little parts of the
Tipping Bird’s wings to rest in. Soon they were flying over the side
of the cliff, and then landed in a beautiful valley of soft feathers.</p>

<p>“‘You must sleep in your good soft bed instead of the chair,’ said

history. We belong to the Sugar Maple family. Our trees
are often used in making furniture, and our sap gives wondrous
maple sugar which boys and girls and ladies and gentlemen love so
much!</p>

<p>“And when autumn comes we all dress up in the most wonderful
costumes of red and orange and flaming gold. But we will not talk
about autumn quite yet.</p>

<p>“The work for us to do now is to see that each leaf grows to be as
big and beautiful as possible. For we have been known as one of the
nicest of shade trees. We keep the sun from shining down too hard
on people during the hot summer months. We make shady avenues
and streets and driveways.</p>

<p>“Mr. Sun is a perfectly splendid old chap, but in the summer he gets
so excited that he is very warm, indeed, and the people love the shade
we can give. So you see, leaves, you must not be lazy!”</p>

<p>The leaves rustled and shook their heads. “No, Mother Maple,
we will not be lazy.”</p>

<p>“We have many cousins,” continued Mother Maple. “There is
Cousin Sycamore Maple whose family comes from far away. Cousin
Sycamore is not very strong and its flowers are late in coming out.
Now Cousin Norway Maple is quite different. A fine strong tree
Cousin Norway is, and a tree that doesn’t mind soot and dust and
smoke or insects. Many of Cousin Norway’s children are planted in
city streets where there is a great deal of smoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span></p>

<p>“There is Cousin Box Elder which is a relation because it has clusters
of ‘keys’ or seeds, which hang on all winter.</p>

<p>“Cousin Striped Maple is very beautiful with its streaked white lines.
In the winter oftentimes its bark is used by boys for whistles and in
the autumn Cousin Striped Maple is yellow and very handsome.</p>

<p>“As for Mr. Mountain Maple—well, Cousin Mountain is so named
because upon all mountains the Mountain Maple loves to grow and
Cousin Vine Maple is so named because it hasn’t the strength to stand
up by itself and its stems are like vines.</p>

<p>“Cousin Silver Maple is very beautiful but is not strong enough to
stand the city. Cousin Silver likes parks which are given over to trees
and greens and plants.</p>

<p>“And then there are the red maple and the black maple. Cousin
Black Maple is almost exactly like us, but its branches are orange
colored and its ‘keys’ spread more widely than ours do.</p>

<p>“Cousin Red Maple loves the swamps and is a beautiful tree, as
are all his children, but I’m glad we belong to the Sugar Maple family.”</p>

daddy, “I saw some great things which were made to look
like big fish. They were made of rubber, I was told, and
pumped up like automobile tires, and then they were covered with
canvas.</p>

<p>“Their eyes were painted on the canvas, so were their fins and their
tails. They looked like very funny fishes but still they did not look
quite right. And people were riding on top of them in the water, and
what games they did have with the breakers. The fishes would rush in
to the shore when a great wave would come and the people would have
a most glorious ride. And children rode them, too. They’re not in
the least dangerous, for if any one falls off in the water when he is
riding a fish which lies right on top, he has no distance to fall at all,
and simply gets a nice, jolly ducking.</p>

<p>“But by holding on fast no one need fall off—just lie or sit on the
fish and the breakers and the fish do the rest.</p>

<p>“Well, such fun as every one was having at the beach. The children
were laughing and crying out, ‘Let’s ride the sport fish.’</p>

<p>“Big men and grown-up ladies were saying, ‘Let’s ride the breakers
on the sport fish. My, how they go! Aren’t they fun.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span></p>

<p>“And I am quite sure that farther out in the ocean real fishes were
saying, ‘Well, isn’t it a shame! Here there are make-believe fishes
that are thought more of than we are. And we’re real, not just imitations!’</p>

<p>“But I also felt sure that old Grandfather Ocean Fish said, ‘Now,
look here, we have no right to get mad. We never offered our backs
for folks to ride on. And we never rushed in to the shore on the
great breakers. So we can’t grumble. For the sport fishes—not real
like us, to be sure—will help the grown-ups and children have the kind
of fun they like.’”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day139">MAY 18: Mother Sheep</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“My beautiful baby, Laura Lamb,” said Mother Sheep, “we
always follow the leader. We’re gentle and we’re quiet.
We’re rather timid, too. We don’t think a great deal
for ourselves.</p>

<p>“They say,” Mother Sheep continued, “that when people cannot sleep
they make believe they are seeing sheep, and that they are counting
them going through a gate. That is because sheep follow each other,
and if one were going through a gate the others would be going
through, too.</p>

<p>“Oh, they get tired, you see, of counting the sheep they make believe
that they see! And so they go to sleep!</p>

<p>“And you see what a help we are to people when we do such things,
so that they can see us in their minds going through a gate—one after
the other.</p>

<p>“You see, my Laura Lamb, if sheep should go different ways then
people couldn’t be helped toward sleep by us, and it is nice to think
of helping people to sleep, for we’re gentle, kind souls, and it is nice
to help.</p>

<p>“So, Laura Lamb, you, too, always follow the leader. Don’t go
through one gate yourself and have your cousins going through another
and some other cousins through the opening in the fence and the others
perhaps going under the fence.</p>

<p>“We must all go together, we sheep.”</p>

<p>And Laura Lamb bleated and said: “Ba-aaa-baa-aaa, Mother
Sheep! I will do as you say.”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“The Animals in the Zoo were boasting one day,” said daddy.</p>

<p>“‘I am the most wonderful of you all,’ said the Black-Footed
Penguin. ‘I live in water and on the rocks. My
ways are interesting. I have strange habits, and what is more my
voice is like a donkey’s. I can bray most beautifully.’</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ laughed the Donkey who was passing along the road.
‘The idea of comparing yourself to me.’ And the Donkey stopped
quite still, even though he was pulling a cart in which was a little Girl.</p>

<p>“‘Go on,’ said the little Girl. But the Donkey stood quite still.</p>

<p>“‘You can’t bray as well as I can,’ said the Donkey.</p>

<p>“‘I bray just the same way,’ said the Black-Footed Penguin.</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ laughed the Hyena, ‘most People and Animals don’t think
a Donkey’s voice is anything very fine.’ And the Hyena went on
laughing and laughing, almost until his sides burst!</p>

<p>“‘If you’re going to be rude,’ said the Donkey, ‘I shall leave.’</p>

<p>“‘At last,’ said the little Girl in the cart, ‘the Donkey has decided
to move. I thought I might have to sit here all day.’</p>

<p>“‘Ah,’ said the Sea Lion, ‘none of you are as fine as I am. I jump
into the air to get my food. I don’t get it in any commonplace, ordinary
way. No indeed, I jump for it. Each time I do a trick. And
they stop and look at me. For I am very interesting.’</p>

<p>“‘It’s much nicer,’ said the bushy-tailed Wood-Rat, ‘to be what I
am. My tail is the wonder of the world.’</p>

<p>“‘I never heard that before,’ said the Flying Squirrels. ‘Now with
us, it is different. We can fly! We are like Birds. That’s very superior.’</p>

<p>“‘But you’re not Birds,’ said a Sparrow, who was flying by the
cages, and over the yards of the Animals. ‘At the rate you are talking,
I am about as interesting as any of you. I can fly for that matter, and
I can pick up food. I fly down for it instead of flying up for it like
Mr. Sea Lion.’</p>

<p>“‘I don’t fly up for it,’ said Mr. Sea Lion. ‘I jump for it.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, all right,’ said the Sparrow. ‘I’m sure I don’t care whether
you jump or fly. You’re very fussy about words, it seems to me.’</p>

<p>“‘Look at me,’ said the Seal. ‘I come from a wonderful land, and
I am a thing of great beauty. My skin is beautiful. And I swim
so nicely, and I like the water so much.’</p>

<p>“‘You’re no better than I am,’ said the Alligator crossly.</p>

<p>“‘Nonsense,’ said the Seal, ‘but I won’t quarrel with you about it,
for I know I’m right.’</p>

<p>“‘I have the finest coat,’ said the Zebra. ‘Now, in truth, I am
something worth looking at.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span></p>

<p>“‘You’re queer, that’s all,’ said the Rocky Mountain Sheep from
his yard.</p>

<p>“The Australian Dog who looked like a Fox also got into the argument,
but back in the Zoo house, the Monkeys were saying:</p>

<p>“‘Now, to-morrow let us see who gets the most admiration and
attention. Then we will see who is the most interesting Animal in
the Zoo.’</p>

<p>“‘All right,’ agreed the other Animals, for each was quite sure he’d
win. The word was whispered about the Zoo that the visitors should
decide the question.</p>

<p>“The next day the Children began to arrive—and all day long they
kept coming. Each Animal had fussed to look his best, and when
the Children would pause and stop to admire any Animal the others
would look angry.</p>

<p>“They stopped before every Animal for a few moments, and would
say to each other:</p>

<p>“‘Oh, look at this queer Animal! See what he does!’ But then
they would pass on and in front of the Monkey cages they stood. The
Monkeys performed tricks, they made faces and they ate peanuts which
were given to them, and at the end of the day, alas and alack, every
Animal had to admit that the one who received the most attention
from the Children was the old Monkey and his family.”</p>

to-night? It’s the first warm evening of the season,
and without a doubt the people will sit out on their porches
and enjoy the beautiful air.”</p>

<p>“They won’t enjoy us,” said the second mosquito.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m sure we wouldn’t be flattered if they did,” said the first
mosquito. “If they enjoyed us it would mean that we didn’t bite them,
and that would never do.”</p>

<p>“It would never do,” agreed the second mosquito.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s be off, for the sun has gone down and the people will
have finished their suppers before long.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said the first mosquito, “I’m ready, and I’ll give a call
to the children and to the cousins and to all of the family and relatives.”</p>

<p>“Buzz-buzz-buzz,” came back the answers, and soon all the mosquito
relatives had joined the first two mosquitoes.</p>

<p>“Every one, without a doubt,” said the mosquitoes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span></p>

<p>So they all started forth and buzzed along, talking of people who
felt them most.</p>

<p>“We don’t want to go to those who’re not properly bitten by mosquitoes,”
said the first mosquito.</p>

<p>“I heard some one say, the other day,” said the second mosquito,
“that the two creatures she hated most were the flies and the mosquitoes.
She said she didn’t like yellow-jackets and hornets, but
practically every other creature she liked.</p>

<p>“Now, wasn’t that a nice compliment?”</p>

<p>“A large one,” said they all.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by a large compliment?” asked the second mosquito.
“You should say a big compliment. But still what do we care
about words except a few choice ones such as bite and bitten and will
bite?” So the mosquitoes hurried, and some of them went on one
piazza where people were sitting and some on another, and were happy
over their mean banquet.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day142">MAY 21: The Potato Bugs</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“Well, it is time we should get started,” said Mrs. Potato
Bug.</p>

<p>“And we must work hard,” said Mr. Potato Bug.</p>

<p>“We have such fun working,” said the little potato bugs.</p>

<p>The potato bugs had six legs apiece. They had little black feelers
and tiny eyes. They were yellow and black on the back, and blue and
brown underneath.</p>

<p>They spit a little yellow juice on any one who took hold of them,
for they said:</p>

<p>“It’s all right for us to treat the potatoes badly, but it is a different
thing for people to have the bad manners to pick us up as if we were
little creatures of no importance.”</p>

<p>There were also brick-red bugs with black dots on either side.
These were the little potato bugs, while the others were the daddies
and the mothers. They got on the leaves of the first potato crop and
fed off them, eating away at the leaves as hard and as fast as such tiny
creatures could do.</p>

<p>These little bugs were very anxious to kill the plants and they would
have done so if they had made a good headway. That is, they would
have done a great deal of harm if they hadn’t been driven away in time.</p>

<p>But these bugs went to other potatoes and they saw some of the
potato grubs, so they said to them:</p>

<p>“Potato grubs, what are you doing?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span></p>

<p>“We’re eating holes in the potatoes,” said the grubs. “What are
you doing?”</p>

<p>“We were eating leaves of potato plants,” said the potato bugs.
“We were driven away from some other plants, but here we are, and
the dear little children have come, too.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to eat the leaves here?” asked the grubs.</p>

<p>“We think they look good,” said the potato bugs.</p>

<p>“They do,” said the grubs, “but of course we pay all our compliments
to the potatoes themselves. We don’t bother about the leaves.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said the potato bugs, “the potatoes wouldn’t mind it
if you didn’t pay them such compliments.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not,” said the grubs, “but we do, just the same. We say
to the potatoes:</p>

<p>“‘Dear potatoes, we love you. Let us show you how fond we are
of you by eating you.’”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha, ha,” laughed the potato bugs, “that is a good joke.”</p>

<p>“The farmers don’t like the jokes, though,” said the grubs. “They
think they and their wives and their children and their neighbors and
their friends are the ones who should pay such compliments to the
potatoes.”</p>

<p>“Absurd,” said the potato bugs.</p>

<p>“Of course,” admitted the grubs, “it is not so absurd if we put ourselves
in their places, but who in the world ever imagined that a grub
would put itself in the place of a person? No one would, so why
should we do it? And we don’t.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said the potato bugs, “and neither do we. If we cared
for people we wouldn’t eat the leaves and we wouldn’t try to destroy
the plants.”</p>

<p>“We’re not friendly with farmers even if we do like potato hills,”
said the grubs.</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said the potato bugs, “and why should we be friendly
with the farmers? They don’t like us. They ask us to leave. They
try to get rid of us.</p>

<p>“They never invite us to have some of the leaves of the potatoes,
any more than they ask you to bite holes and eat of the potatoes.</p>

<p>“We have to invite ourselves and look after ourselves. It’s too bad
the farmers don’t like us when we like the potatoes they plant.”</p>

<p>And so the potato bugs and the grubs tried to do all they could to
hurt the farmer’s crop of potatoes. And they didn’t even feel badly,
they were so naughty!</p>

<p class="dropcap">“The Meadow Mouse and the Mole,” said daddy, “had become
very good friends. They both lived near each other
in the field, and they used to visit each other in their holes
under the ground.</p>

<p>“‘What do you think of the food this year?’ asked Mr. Meadow
Mouse, just as if he were staying at a hotel and wanted things the way
he asked for them.</p>

<p>“‘Well, I think it’s pretty good,’ said Mr. Mole. ‘The farmer
planted all the things I like best this year, and so I’ve had a very
good time.’ Just then they heard a voice say:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>“Pretty soon Mr. Meadow Mouse and Mr. Mole were off for the
next meadow, where the Fairy Queen told them they’d be safe, and
all their children with them. Mrs. Meadow Mouse and Mrs. Mole
didn’t care about moving, but when they were told that their heads
would be chopped off if they didn’t, they hurried along!</p>

<p>“And when they got to the next meadow, they began to burrow
in the ground and dig it up with their little noses. Especially good
for such work was Mr. Mole, and his children all copied him, and were
a great help.”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“Hello, aprons, gloves, toys, books, games, gold fish, party
dresses, gingham dresses,” called Fairy Grant-Your-Wishes
to the toys and clothes in the children’s big store.</p>

<p>They all called back “Hello.” That is, all those did who were
awake this evening and who weren’t so tired that they went to sleep
at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span></p>

<p>“What is this I hear that you want?” she asked.</p>

<p>“We all wish we were something else,” said the gingham dress. “I’d
like to be a party dress, and the party dress is tired of its ribbons and
laces. The gold fish down the aisle wants to be—what is it you want
to be, gold fish?”</p>

<p>“I want to be a toy,” said the gold fish.</p>

<p>“And oh,” said a pair of brown jumpers, “I want to be myself. But
I want a playmate. I’d like to have a doll, please, Fairy!”</p>

<p>“The doll you shall have,” said the fairy. “I’ll wave my wand.”</p>

<p>As she did so the whole store began to grow and grow, it seemed.
Each counter was now like a store in itself and none of the counters
were near each other. There were great, enormous roadways between
the counters and the things themselves were all different. The gingham
dress was now a party dress. It was wonderful how a party dress
had been made out of the gingham one, for the gingham dress saw
that there was some of the old dress left.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said the gingham dress, now a party dress, “I do want to go
to a party now.”</p>

<p>“You shall,” said Fairy-Grant-Your-Wishes, suddenly appearing
again. “Every one is to have a complete, whole wish granted this
evening. And all of the others will go where they please and be what
they please.”</p>

<p>Such a change as there was. The gingham dress, now a party dress,
found herself at a great party. There were many boys and girls and
they looked at her as she came in the doorway. Oh, how strange
and uncomfortable she felt. It was really a most miserable feeling.</p>

<p>“Do we make mud pies later on?” she asked of another party dress.</p>

<p>“Ha, Ha,” said the other party dress, “where did you come from
that you didn’t know that at parties such as this we don’t do such
things. We couldn’t soil our clothes. I do believe your grandmother
must have been a gingham. My grandmother,” the other party dress
said very proudly, as she walked off tittering and giggling, “was a Lady
Lace and she went to court affairs where my grandfather, Lord Velvet,
met her.”</p>

<p>“What horrid, snobbish creatures,” said the gingham dress. “Oh,
dear, what shall I do? No one will be friendly with me. I wish I
were going to a good outdoor garden-playground party where children
and clothes did things so I wouldn’t feel so strange.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Fairy-Grant-Your-Wishes. “I will make you happy
and change you back to what you were.”</p>

ever painted. It is very proud and disagreeable about it.</p>

<p>“If the house were receiving any other kind of a coat I wouldn’t

rubber for the rain or fur perhaps for the winter, but then I’m not

<p>“Perfectly true,” said the song sparrow, “I don’t wish to correct

<p>“But a coat of paint is entirely different.”</p>

<p>“Whiz, whiz, I should say not,” whistled the wind.</p>

<p>“But the house,” continued the tree, “pretends it is very wonderful.
It is trying to look so fresh and stuck-up.”</p>

<p>“You must forgive those things,” said the song sparrow, “as the
paint makes the house behave like that.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said the tree. “I suppose I was a bit harsh. But you
know my trunk was painted this spring, painted white, to protect me

proud fashion.”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Evelyn rushed up to Jack as soon as he came out of school
one day.</p>

<p>“Oh, Jack,” she said, “something is the matter with Marian.
She behaves so queerly. She said she wanted to have me play with the
other girls; she had something special to do at home. She really
wouldn’t let me go home with her. I would have been mad only she
was just too queer for anything. I don’t understand.”</p>

<p>“Jock was the same way; let’s go back, anyway, and see what is up.”
Jock and Marian were cousins who had recently come to town.</p>

<p>They hurried down a street, running most of the way, and then turned
down another and ran almost all of five more blocks to reach their
cousins’ home.</p>

<p>Jack went half-way down the hall when he bumped straight into
Jock coming up from the cellar. He was holding in his arms the
little fox terrier Marian had bought just a week before with her birthday<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
money. The dog was only a tiny puppy still, a lovely little soft
white puppy with one brown ear and one black one and two black spots
on his soft white back.</p>

<p>“Oh, did Buster get hurt?” Jack shouted. Buster, of course, was
the small, gay, naughty, happy puppy.</p>

<p>“No, he didn’t,” said Jock. “And it’s none of your business, anyway,
even if you are our cousins.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Marian, who came up behind Jock. “If we want to
have Buster’s tail cut, it’s no one’s business but our own. It was just
like you to find out somehow.”</p>

<p>“Going to have his tail cut?” gasped Evelyn and burst into tears.</p>

<p>“Yes, fox terriers look absurd with long tails,” said Jock; “every one
says so. And, besides, he’ll be all well in a week, quite well.”</p>

<p>“And for the sake of a little style,” said Jack, his teeth clenched
tightly together, “you’d let that dog suffer for a whole week. I just
wish I could cut off a part of your arm, that’s what I do.”</p>

<p>“The bones are soft,” murmured Marian. “He’d look foolish with
a tail, so every one says.”</p>

<p>“What do you care what every one says?” screamed Jack; “you are
two horrid, cruel children, and if you don’t let that poor puppy, who
has never done you any harm, and who is at your mercy, alone, you’ll
never be friends of ours, and we’ll tell others of your cruelty. We
mean it, too.”</p>

<p>And they did mean it, for they didn’t care what any one thought of
them so long as they saved the puppy from being hurt.</p>

<p>But after Jack and Evelyn had told Jock and Marian of the suffering
it would mean for Buster, of course they didn’t do such a cruel thing.
They weren’t really cruel, only they didn’t know that such a thing hurt
dreadfully. They had never been told the real truth, and they were
glad they had heard it in time!</p>

and Jamie. ‘Bedtime, eh?’ for both Jamie and Jack were being shaken
gently and told to trot off to their real bed. But as they both crawled
into their nice soft sheets, they found that they’d each had the very
same dream—and both had seen the Fireplace castles and heard the
Fireplace clock which kept such bad time!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day148">MAY 27: The Jewelweed’s Visitor</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“I am the Jewelweed flower, though I am sometimes known as
the Touch-Me-Not flower, too.</p>

<p>“I have little seed pods and boys and girls love to pop open
these pods, for then my seeds jump forth quite wildly and excitedly.
I mean by my name of Touch-Me-Not, that no one must touch me unless
he wants to be very much surprised!</p>

<p>“I am orange yellow in color and I have reddish spots upon me. I
have also sometimes been called the Wild Lady’s Slipper because I am
shaped something like that. And sometimes I’ve been called Lady’s
Eardrops because my shape is something like a lady’s eardrop, too.</p>

<p>“I’m hoping I will have a caller to-day. I’m expecting one, I know.
And I hope I won’t have to wait long. I haven’t seen this caller for
some time.</p>

<p>“It is most exciting to expect a caller. Very, very exciting!</p>

<p>“They call me Jewelweed because in the early morning when I’ve
taken my morning bath, as all good flowers do, in the Magic Dew
Water which the Dewdrop Brothers bring around to us, I sparkle like
jewelry.</p>

<p>“Oh, indeed! I always take a morning bath. Sometimes when it
showers I take an extra bath.</p>

<p>“And always, when my bath is over, I look for Mr. Sun and I ask
him to make my jewelry look pretty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span></p>

<p>“Then my pretty leaves look so bright and sparkling. Yes, that is
one of the reasons for my name.</p>

<p>“I do hope my visitor will be along soon. I asked him to come
as soon as he came up this way.</p>

<p>“I sent word by the Breeze Brothers to be sure to let him know that
I was waiting for him and that I hoped he would come to see me as
soon as he arrived.</p>

<p>“Ah, I believe I hear my visitor coming. I believe I do.”</p>

<p>“May I come in, buzz-z-z-z-z-z-z-z, may I come in?”</p>

<p>“Oh, do,” said the Jewelweed. “I am expecting you.”</p>

<p>Then appeared Mr. Ruby-Throated Humming Bird who had just
arrived from the South.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “how glad I am to see you.”</p>

<p>“And I am so glad to see you,” said the Jewelweed. “You must have
a cooling sweet drink. I didn’t let any other visitors take any of it.
No indeed! There was the Bee who tried to get me to give him a sweet
drink, but I keep it deep down in my very center dining room where
even the Bee with his long, thirsty tongue can’t get at it.</p>

<p>“I kept it for you, and you, with your tongue which can stretch
out farther than your long bill, will be able to get it.</p>

<p>“Dear Mr. Humming Bird, I am so glad you have come. And you
will have some refreshment, will you not?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I will, thank you, Jewelweed,” said the Humming Bird,
“and it is indeed good of you to save your sweetness for me.”</p>

<p>“Ah, our families have been friends for so many years,” said the
Jewelweed, “and I like to do as my family have always done.”</p>

<p>“I must be off now,” said the Humming Bird, “for as I have only just
arrived I have a good many calls to make. There are a number of my
flower friends who are expecting me to call as soon as I arrive. But
may I come and see you again?”</p>

<p>“Oh, indeed yes,” said the Jewelweed, “and you will always be welcome.
Make your other calls, but come back again soon.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be back soon,” said Mr. Humming Bird. “I have had such a
charming call and it has been such a pleasure to feel that my visit has
been so welcome.”</p>

<p>“Your visits are always welcome and always will be,” said the Jewelweed,
“just so long as there are Jewelweeds and Humming Birds!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day149">MAY 28: Peter’s Birthday Party</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“A little dog named Peter Murray,” said daddy, “was just
one year old. His Mistress was a little girl named Inez and
she was almost fonder of Peter Murray than of anything
else in the world. Inez sent out invitations several days in advance to a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
number of the little boys and girls she knew who owned pet dogs. The
invitations read:</p>

<p class="center">‘Mr. Dog Peter Murray,<br />
At Home,<br />
In Honor of his First Birthday.’</p>

<p>“All of the little dogs who were invited accepted and the day of the
party came at last. The first thing that Inez did that morning was
to rush over to Peter Murray’s basket and say ‘Many happy returns.’
Now, of course, Peter Murray woke right up and was out of his basket
with a bound.</p>

<p>“He jumped up and down for Inez, which was his way of saying,
‘Thank you, Missy,’ and he wagged his tail for all he was worth.</p>

<p>“‘We have lots to do to-day, Peter Murray,’ said Inez, and Peter
Murray knew just what she meant. He put his head first on one side
and then on the other. And when he saw Inez take a little purse
out of her pocket and jingle some pennies he put his ears up in the air
as if to say:</p>

<p>“‘What do those funny things mean?’</p>

<p>“‘They mean,’ said Inez, ‘that we must get goodies for the party,
bones and such things.’</p>

<p>“Now, when Peter heard the word ‘bones’ he wagged his tail, for he
knew perfectly well what bones meant.</p>

<p>“At last the time for the party came. And such a time as they did
have. Every little dog brought Peter Murray a present. He got
wonderful things, too. He was given a great pink bow and a new collar
by his Mistress, which, of course, he wore to the party. Then he received
a fine hard ball, a stick to play with, a second-best collar and a
box of chocolates, for Peter Murray loved candy, too.</p>

<p>“‘Supper time,’ shouted Inez, and all the little dogs wagged their
tails and jumped for the bones that Inez threw up in the air, until every
little dog had one.</p>

<p>“You see they were not fussy like people, and didn’t sit down to eat
their bones, for they had much fun throwing them up in the air
and playing with them. And then came the ice-cream, which they ate
out of little bowls, and for a surprise they had wonderful sugary cake,
with a little dog made in sugar on the top of it! Inez cut the cake, for
in each piece she had to take out a little bell which were the presents
Peter Murray gave to his guests on his birthday!”</p>

“Some of you were the most wonderful shades of lavender and purple
and even pink and white!”</p>

<p>“We like to have different colored frocks,” they said. But then fearing
that they might hurt the feelings of the trailing arbutus family they
added:</p>

<p>“We wouldn’t care about it, though, if we had the lovely pink dresses

<p class="dropcap">“There was once a little boy named Fred,” said daddy. “He
was very fond of soldiers and bands. He had a great many
little toy soldiers, and he would have the most wonderful
drills with them. Last Memorial day his grandfather, who had since
died, had given him a little, old, ragged flag. But it was the stars and
stripes, and Fred cherished it. His grandfather had fought in the
Civil War and all through that war had carried the little flag. Now
his grandfather was gone, and yesterday they had put a fresh flag on
his grave. But Fred had the little flag that had been through the
war.</p>

<p>“That night he was very tired, and he went to bed early. The cool
white sheets and soft pillow were delightful to a very sleepy little boy,
but soon he seemed to be sitting up on the pillow, and before him was
the flag.</p>

<p>“‘I have come,’ said the little flag, ‘because I thought you would
like me to talk to you. Your grandfather went to the Civil War, as
you know.</p>

<p>“‘He was so brave in the war, and, oh, I was so proud while I was
with him all the time that it was for my sake he was fighting! It’s the
most wonderful thing in the world to be a flag even if you’re in rags.’”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day153">JUNE 1: The Robin Parents</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“Over a little balcony,” said daddy, “where a lady used to sit
and sew, there were several roofs adjoining and going off from
different sides of the balcony, and there were eaves running
along the balcony. In the spring a Mr. and Mrs. Robin looked about
them for their home. ‘How about this?’ asked Mr. Robin. He was
pointing to the eaves right over the little balcony.</p>

<p>“‘There is some one there,’ said Mrs. Robin, ‘but she looks very
nice and as though she wouldn’t hurt a little bird for anything. I think
it is perfectly safe. See, she is looking at us and her voice is low, and
she is not frightening us. She is speaking to us; listen to what she says.’
And they listened and heard the lady say: ‘Dear little robins, have
you come to call on me?’</p>

<p>“‘Ah, her voice is so sweet and so nice, and she really seems to be
glad to see us. Let us build our nest here.’</p>

<p>“‘I think it will be a good idea,’ said Mr. Robin.</p>

<p>“So they built their nest under the eaves, right over the balcony
where all day the lady sat, most of the time sewing, some of the time
reading.</p>

<p>“She would have visitors there, too, and sometimes she would tell
them of the robins who were so near-by, but she always saw that no
one frightened the robins, and that they were well looked after.</p>

<p>“She used to put bread-crumbs on the roof near the eaves. And a
little pan of water was always there, too, for bathing or for drinking!</p>

<p>“Mr. and Mrs. Robin built a lovely big nest, and there Mrs. Robin
laid the eggs. After a little while the baby robins came, poor little
timid creatures, with scarcely any feathers at all.</p>

<p>“But Mr. and Mrs. Robin loved them and thought they were beautiful,
just as boys and girls think their little baby brothers and sisters
are beautiful, even if they have no hair on their heads—in fact, they
like them that way, for then they look so appealing and so cunning
and so helpless and yet so glad to be in the world. Usually Mother
Robin guarded the nest, while Father Robin went off for food, for he
was a very fine robin to go to market and pick out all the best things.
He just knew so much about it all and was such a good business robin
that he was a very fine provider.</p>

<p>“And, too, he knew that by helping Mrs. Robin he was sharing in
everything, and he shared in doing what was to be done, it was not
only fair to Mrs. Robin who would get all tired out alone, but it was
also much more fun to help one’s mate.</p>

<p>“So the little robins grew up happily and safely in their nest by the
little balcony.”</p>

<p class="dropcap">“I am going to tell you,” said daddy, “about the mother humming-bird
whose little ones were about to be attacked by a snake
when they were rescued by some brave robins.</p>

<p>“The snake had come over from the vacant field and had crawled
up the honeysuckle vine as the mother humming-bird had gone off for
some food. Some robins hovering near had seen the snake. They
had cried out in terror and had flown over to the nest.</p>

<p>“The mother humming-bird heard the cries and hurried back, but the
robins had frightened off the snake. The snake was not a very large
one, and really he had been frightened by all the noise the robins had
made, and when he saw so many birds flying toward him he got away
very quickly.</p>

<p>“The mother humming-bird got back just as the snake was leaving
the nest.</p>

<p>“She couldn’t thank the robins enough for flying to the rescue and
saving her beloved little ones, but the robins didn’t want any thanks.
They were thankful, too, that the dear little birds had been saved, for
birds are very loyal to one another and will risk any danger to save
each other.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day155">JUNE 3: The Persian Lilacs</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“You know,” said one of the flowering almonds, “I think a
special vote of thanks should be given to the Persian lilacs.
Every year they come out, and after they go their lovely
bushes are still so pretty with their green leaves.</p>

<p>“But best of all is the visit they pay us every single spring. They are
so small and dainty a lilac, their color is such a soft shade of lavender,
they are so beautiful and so flowery and so soft and sweet, and they are
so very, very fragrant that we should tell them how much we love them
and how glad we are each year to see them.</p>

<p>“It is only right to tell nice creatures and things that we like them.
It would be quite unfair any other way at all, and so we should tell
the Persian lilacs that we love them and that we welcome them and that
we are looking forward to seeing them next year.</p>

<p>“We know how the people love them; we know that for years they
have looked forward to seeing the Persian lilacs in the spring and enjoying
them right through the spring, too. We know how, after the
other lilacs have come out, the Persian lilacs bloom and then they last
longer than the others, because they have come later.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” the Persian lilacs said, “it is good of you all to be so kind to
us. Our bushes are all very grateful. But you know we couldn’t help
but come out each spring. Beneath our bushes are beds of lilies of the
valley, the sweet, fragrant lilies of the valley, that nestle in among
their green leaves, and they always talk softly to us and send us their
sweet greetings.</p>

<p>“Then the people are so fond of us; they love their Persian lilacs so,
and all the flowers are so kind to us and help us add to the fragrance
of the spring garden. There is no jealousy, and every one is trying
to add his sweetness to the whole. We will always come out, never
fear!” they ended.</p>

<p class="dropcap">“One day Mother Raccoon was just about to start telling one
of her stories,” said daddy, “when Daddy Raccoon saw
all the children around her.</p>

<p>“‘Now this afternoon,’ said Daddy Raccoon, ‘I want to take all
those silly little ’Coons and show them how they can become brave
big ’Coons such as I am.’ And he thrust his tail this way and that with
an air which said, ‘I’m certainly one of the finest, bravest Animals any
one could hope to be like.’</p>

<p>“All the little ’Coons looked very mournful when they heard that
they were to be taken off to learn how to hunt in the swamp near-by.
They were always very much frightened when they went near the
swamp, for they had often heard the sound of a big gun, or had seen a
dangerous Man with a gun over his shoulder getting in behind the
bushes.</p>

<p>“They began to wail and yell, but Daddy Raccoon was firm and as he
was the head of the house—or rather the big tree without any leaves—Mother
Raccoon had to let them all go.</p>

<p>“But as they were following Daddy Raccoon, she called out to them,
‘If anything happens to you wish very hard that you will be all right
and the Fairy Queen may possibly be near-by and will grant you the
wish.’</p>

<p>“Daddy Raccoon sniffed with scorn at such a remark, but he said
that Mother Raccoon was such a sweet old dear she even thought well
of the Rabbit family—and so she was apt to think so much of the
Fairies in the same way.</p>

<p>“And off they all started. Some of the little ’Coons were rather proud
at going off to hunt in the swamp and really pretended they were tired
of Fairy Stories and were glad that Daddy Raccoon had thought it was
time for them to grow up.</p>

<p>“Soon they reached the swamp and in they went to hunt for food to
last them many days, as Daddy Raccoon had said.</p>

<p>“They did just as they were told and were beginning to be very good
hunters and were learning just how to pick out the best parts of the
swamp—when suddenly—an awful bang was heard near-by.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, dear; oh, dear,’ shouted the little ’Coons.</p>

<p>“‘Do be quiet, or they’ll know where we are,’ said Daddy Raccoon.</p>

<p>“The second bang sounded very much nearer and they all trembled,
when one little ’Coon said, ‘Oh, if any little Fairy is hovering near—please
tell the horrid man with the gun to go away.’ And, would you
believe it, that man was heard to say:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span></p>

<p>“‘Well, I guess they’re all away for the day and I won’t try to catch
Raccoons until to-morrow.’ Then Daddy Raccoon took all the
little ones back to the old tree where Mother Raccoon was sitting
curled up, shaking with fear while waiting.</p>

<p>“‘Tell them all the stories you want to,’ said Daddy Raccoon, ‘for
one of your Fairy friends saved all our lives and whispered to the man
with the gun to go home!’”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day157">JUNE 5: The New Mole Home</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“Mr. Mole was going to get married,” said daddy, “and he
wanted to build a fine, fine home for the new Mrs. Mole.
So he went forth into the nicest meadow he could find, and
there, just at the end of it, near an old fence, Mr. Mole started to burrow
into the ground.</p>

<p>“You know the Moles live underground almost all of the time, and
there make their homes. Just near the fence Mr. Mole began to dig
and dig. First of all he made a long, long tunnel, a funny underground
passage which he called the Drive-Way of his Home!</p>

<p>“Of course the callers of Mr. and Mrs. Mole could hardly drive
along this tunnel, but they could run and scamper along, and they liked
to call it by a big name like Drive-Way.</p>

<p>“And after the long, long tunnel Mr. Mole started in to make a fine
house out of the earth. He made lovely rooms, one for Mrs. Mole,
one for himself, one for the little Mole who was to do the cooking and
housekeeping and several guest rooms. For, as you can imagine, Mr.
Mole was very fond of company. In addition to all this Mr. Mole
built a very fine picture gallery—made in tiers of earth and mud—long
rows and rows of it. On these he put pictures of his family which
he made out of earth, too. Of course, Mr. Mole made every member
of his family look just alike, but that didn’t make any difference. The
Moles are not very fussy if their pictures aren’t very well taken, for
they can’t bother to look at pictures much of the time.</p>

<p>“You see their eyes are very small and they like to look at things
more worth while—such as food and corn starting to grow in the
ground and all the things the farmers plant. They love farms, you
know, where wonderful vegetables are planted deep down in the earth.
They are very apt to burrow along and make paths so they can walk
to a farmland and have a feast.</p>

<p>“But I must tell you more about Mr. Mole’s new home. The very
last thing he did was to build a beautiful throne in the picture-gallery
for Mrs. Mole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span></p>

<p>“At last it was time for her to come to her new home and Mr. Mole
had invited their friends and cousins, the Mole-Crickets, to come, too.
These cousins have very strangely shaped front legs with which they
burrow homes just like the regular Moles, and so they are considered
relations.</p>

<p>“‘Here we all are,’ said Mrs. Mole, and she blinked her very small
eyes, while all the other Moles blinked their tiny eyes, too, and looked
about them. Through the Drive-Way they ran until they came to the
house with all the beautiful rooms.</p>

<p>“The room Mr. Mole took them to last was the picture-gallery,
where Mrs. Mole sat on the throne in honor of her wedding day, and
the little Mole, who cooked, brought out some of the delicious stewed
vegetables she had made for the wedding feast.</p>

<p>“You should have heard the Moles as they looked at the pictures.
They thought every picture was one of their own relatives.</p>

<p>“One Mole would say:</p>

<p>“‘Why, there’s Mama,’ and another would say:</p>

<p>“‘Why, no, that’s not your Mama, that’s my Papa.’ However,
they didn’t get in the least angry about the pictures—in fact, they
thought it very clever of Mr. Mole to make pictures which looked
like all their relations at the same time.</p>

<p>“‘But you haven’t noticed my wedding dress,’ said Mrs. Mole. ‘I
think my new Home is S-C-R-U-M-P-T-I-O-U-S, which means beautiful
in case any of you little Moles don’t understand the word I’ve said
in honor of the day. And now that you’ve all admired my home, please
admire my dress.’</p>

<p>“For the first time the Moles noticed that Mrs. Mole had attached
to her tiny ears little earrings made of mud with a red berry in each,
and she wore a necklace to match. Her dress was of dull oak leaves
which Mrs. Mole had saved for a whole year to wear on her wedding
day.</p>

<p>“‘You’re a handsome Mole,’ said Mr. Mole, ‘and I’m so proud
you’re to share this home I’ve made,’ and all the other Moles grinned
and ate more and more of the vegetable wedding feast to show what a
good time they were having.”</p>

<p class="dropcap">“I think I will tell you about a very lucky little girl who once

<p>“This little girl loved the water. She had always lived near
a lake, and she could swim and row.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span></p>

<p>“Now, this little girl had a great big brother who worked in an office
in the big city. He had only a short holiday every year—just two
weeks—but during those two weeks he would come home and teach her
new strokes in swimming and new ways of diving, for he was very
anxious that no one should be able to excel his sister as a swimmer.</p>

<p>“And secretly he longed to give his sister a canoe so she could go
on the water just as much as she wanted to, and, as she was such a good
swimmer, he felt it would be perfectly safe for her to own one.</p>

<p>“But, of course, a canoe is quite expensive, and the heads of offices in
the big city do not consider that the big brothers may want to buy
their little sisters canoes with the money they earn. Perhaps they think
it is very silly to even dream of such things as canoes. But slowly during
the winter the big brother had saved just as much money as a canoe
would cost, and in June he wrote his sister a little note.</p>

<p>“In the note he said that he had a ‘little present’ for her which he
had had put in the cellar and that she would find it there if she went and
looked.</p>

<p>“Now, the little girl could not for a moment imagine what kind of a
present would be put in the cellar. But she hurried down to see.</p>

<p>“And there—right before her eyes—was a lovely big green canoe—just
the very nicest shade of green—and there beside it were the two
paddles. Well, she could hardly speak. She had never dreamed that
she would own a canoe, or, anyway, not for years and years and years.</p>

<p>“On the canoe was printed ‘Indian Girl,’ but she at once named it
Papoose, which means, you know, a little Indian baby.</p>

<p>“You see, her big brother had arranged that the canoe should be
taken down into the cellar when the little girl was asleep, so the surprise
would be perfect. And it certainly was!</p>

<p>“In another week the big brother came up from the city, and they
spent all their time in the green canoe on the lake.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day159">JUNE 7: The Bunnie and the Fox</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“In the woods,” said daddy, “there lived a mother Rabbit and all
her little children. They had a beautiful home—as nice as
could be, in one of the finest brier patches ever known. Mother
Rabbit was really extremely proud of her home and used to give many
fine receptions there for the animals. Especially wonderful were her
carrot receptions. The thing that worried Mother Rabbit most of
all was that little Bunnie Bonnie, her youngest son, was very, very curious.
Of course, Rabbits are always inclined to be curious, but Bunnie<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
Bonnie was even more so than most of his family. And he was sociable.
Entirely too sociable his mother thought.</p>

<p>“He liked to go to every party that was given in the woods—even if
the parties were not given by his friends.</p>

<p>“Now, one day a black fox moved to the woods to live. None of
the animals were pleased to hear that he’d come to stay, for that meant
they would have to think of getting out of his way, and doing as he
said. Many of the animals left food at the entrance to his home so
he wouldn’t eat them up instead!</p>

<p>“Mr. Black Fox looked all about the neighborhood and he noticed
Bunnie Bonnie scampering around more than any of the others. So
one day he spoke to him and this is what he said:</p>

<p>“‘I’m glad to see you’re a brave Rabbit, and that you’re not afraid
of me. Some of these other silly Rabbits tremble when they see me
and leave me good things to eat—but I know why they do that. They
want me to get all through my meals at home, and not go looking near
their homes for extra delicacies—such as their small children.</p>

<p>“‘But it’s so absurd. They’re abusing me. Just because I’m black
it doesn’t mean that I’m cruel and bad. In fact, I’m very kind and
very good.’</p>

<p>“Of course, Bunnie Bonnie should have known that if Mr. Black Fox
was so good he wouldn’t have found it necessary to talk about it. But
Bunnie Bonnie never thought of that—and he forgot—completely forgot—that
the Fox family is known to be very sly.</p>

<p>“‘And,’ continued Mr. Black Fox, ‘I’d be greatly honored if you’d
come to supper with me this evening.’</p>

<p>“‘I’d be pleased to,’ said Bunnie Bonnie.</p>

<p>“Now, Bunnie Bonnie’s mother was giving one of her receptions that
afternoon so she told the children to play in the little garden she had
back of her home in the brier patch. And Bunnie Bonnie left his little
sisters and brothers to have supper with Mr. Black Fox.</p>

<p>“Mr. Black Fox was sitting outside his front door waiting for
Bunnie Bonnie. He was chuckling to himself, and his eyes looked very
wicked and cruel. But when he saw Bunnie Bonnie running up his path-way,
he began to smile and called out in the pleasantest tone he could
use:</p>

<p>“‘Hello, Bunnie Bonnie.’</p>

<p>“‘Hello, Mr. Black Fox. Here I am, and, oh, I’m so hungry, too.
I didn’t stop to get any of my Mother’s carrots as they were being
fixed for her party, but came right along!’</p>

<p>“‘I’m going to have something better than carrots for my supper.’</p>

<p>“‘What?’ said Bunnie Bonnie in a cheery tone, for little did he
suspect the old Fox.</p>

<p>“‘I’m going to have you, you little stupid,’ roared Mr. Black Fox,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
but Bunnie gave one bound and ran for the brier patch. He
just reached there ahead of Mr. Black Fox, and never again did he
leave his family for new friends.”</p>

<p>“You see, buzz buzz, I don’t like to do anything that is small. I

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day161">JUNE 9: Ladybug’s Lecture</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“Dear little Ladybugs, gather around me,” said Ladybug,
“for I am going to give a lecture.</p>

<p>“It will be a free lecture, and pray, Ladybugs, do not
think that on that account it will be poor. Too many folks have the
idea that nothing is good that is free.</p>

<p>“They don’t bother to find out how many nice things are free, and
they don’t stop to think about them. Take birds and their concerts—quite
free.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span></p>

<p>“And lovely wild flowers—quite free. And the woods and lakes
and rivers and ponds—practically all of them free. And many free
concerts and oh, so many things that if I go on talking about them I
will never have time for my lecture.</p>

<p>“So I shall begin my lecture if all the Ladybugs are ready, and if the
Ladybug who has charge of this hall (for I must call this place where
I am lecturing a hall) will kindly bring me an acorn filled with water
I shall be much obliged. Lecturers should always have such things by
them, and oh yes, a light and a pointer to point to my maps and my
pictures. But on second thought they won’t be necessary for I have
no maps and no pictures. Well, then, are we all ready?”</p>

<p>A little Ladybug came hurrying up with the acorn filled with water
and said in a low tone, “If you want any more I’ll bring it in to you.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said the Ladybug, who was about to lecture.</p>

<p>“Now, friends,” she began, “Mrs. President, Lady Chairman, I greet
you.”</p>

<p>There was no Mrs. President and no Lady Chairman, but that
didn’t make any difference.</p>

<p>“I have something very fine to tell you. Something very fine upon
a subject which strikes close to the heart of all of us.”</p>

<p>Ladybug, the lecturer, placed one of her legs in the direction of her
heart and looked very fine indeed doing so.</p>

<p>In a moment or two she went on: “I have heard, and it is quite
true, that we have all been paid a very great compliment. We have
been paid one of the greatest of compliments.</p>

<p>“It has been both expensive and a bit difficult to get to Europe of
late—especially has it been too expensive, and I don’t believe any of
the Ladybugs have enough money in the Ladybugs’ bank to use that
to go to Europe.</p>

<p>“It’s a fine bank and it is nice to go to a bank where ladies are
especially looked after and all of that.</p>

<p>“But we haven’t enough money in the bank. Dear me no, not nearly
enough.</p>

<p>“However, those of our family who were chosen to go weren’t
asked how much money they had at all. They weren’t even asked if
they had any money.</p>

<p>“They weren’t even asked if they would pay for their laundry and
their own food.</p>

<p>“They were just invited to go and were told the work they would
do would be enough thanks for the opportunity they were having to
travel.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Ladybug, “many, many, many Ladybugs have been
shipped to France to destroy bad insects.</p>

<p>“Of course, I’m not sure whether the Ladybugs can talk French or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
not, but they can work anyway and make the whole Ladybug world
proud of them.</p>

<p>“But I think it would be interesting if we all studied a little French
so that we would be able to say how-do-you-do and good-by and pleased-to-meet-you
in French, in case we’re called upon next. And my lecture
is not only free. It is quite, quite true.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” said all the Ladybugs when they had finished cheering the
speaker, “we will all study a little French and be ready. Ah, what an
honor for the Ladybugs of this land!”</p>

<p>“Gorgeous,” said Ladybug, the lecturer.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“We are mad, Mother Ocean,” said some of the waves.
“We’ve never been given a fair chance. We’ve always
been here—your children; we’ve had to do just as you said.
We’ve been allowed to play when you’ve been perfectly willing we
should play and when you’ve been willing to ask the Wind to play with
us. But we’ve had to do as you and the Wind said.</p>

<p>“And we’ve had to sleep when you’ve told us to. It’s not fair.
Just because we’re only some of the drops of water which belong to
you we haven’t any say of our own.”</p>

<p>“What is it you would like to do?” asked Mother Ocean in her deep,
great voice.</p>

<p>“We’d like to see more of the world,” they said.</p>

<p>“We’d like to go traveling. We’d like to see what the cities and
forests are like; we’d like to see some other creatures beside fishes and
people swimming in us. We’re tired of an ocean life.</p>

<p>“We want to live on the land. We want to do great things—what
do we do here that ever amounts to anything?”</p>

<p>“So you’d like to see the world?” asked Mother Ocean. “Well,
Waves, go forth; I won’t stop you. And may you come back to me
with stories of adventures!”</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day163">JUNE 11: The Waves’ Adventures</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">When the waves were told they could leave Mother Ocean
they weren’t so happy as they had expected to be.</p>

<p>They had really expected Mother Ocean to forbid them to
go—then they could continue grumbling, which they were quite enjoying.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
Now they felt they must start at once to show that they were
really anxious to see the world. They didn’t want to let Mother Ocean
see that they would rather stay where they were quite comfortable and
where they could grumble! Mother Ocean was sighing a little.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to see you go,” she said. “It’s the first time any of my
children or grandchildren have wanted to leave me.”</p>

<p>The Waves didn’t look at Mother Ocean. Instead, they pulled their
beautiful white caps down over their heads and shed a salt water tear
or two. Then they picked up their shell suit-cases from Mother Ocean’s
ground floor, packed in their sea-weed nighties and their best sea-green
suits and sea-blue party dresses and were off.</p>

<p>They ran over the beach and rudely went right over the feet of
some people who were sitting down on the beach reading books. Then
they scrambled on, stumbled and scrambled on a little farther.</p>

<p>“Oh dear,” said one of the waves; “oh dear, the sun makes me feel
so dizzy.”</p>

<p>“And I feel so hot and dry,” said another. “Oh dear, oh dear! I
must weep.” But not even any salt tears would come to the wave’s
dry eyes.</p>

<p>“Are you ready to have adventures?” asked a little creature who
suddenly came up to the waves. He looked like a little brownie and he
seemed quite amused at meeting the waves. “I’ve heard you wanted
to see the world and to do great things,” he continued. They wanted
to tell him he would look far better in a cool green suit than in his
warm-looking brown one, but suddenly they realized that they could
only speak the language of the ocean and that he couldn’t understand
them, though they could understand him, for they had so often heard
people speak.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you’re trying to say,” he grinned, “but I suppose
you mean to say ‘Yes,’ as I’ve been told you’ve come to see the world.</p>

<p>“Well, first we shall take a trip through some forests.”</p>

<p>They tried to follow the brownie, and found it was very hard work.
He led them along so fast, and they couldn’t make him understand that
they’d like a drink of water and a cooling bath.</p>

<p>Pretty soon they found themselves in some very dark forests. All
around them were strange birds calling to each other and singing songs
about juicy worms. The waves trembled, for they thought the birds
might sing soon about juicy waves, and then might swallow them
down!</p>

<p>And they saw strange animals, rabbits and woodchucks and squirrels,
all quite small but very terrifying to the waves.</p>

<p>They saw some little red lizards and small snakes which wriggled
along and which didn’t seem in the least friendly like fishes.</p>

<p>After they had passed through the forests and had been frightened<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
almost out of their wits the brownie hurried them along to the edge
of a city and then right into the city.</p>

and sang and through it all Mother Ocean kept smiling and singing

unpopular weed.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“Of all the trees in the orchard,” began daddy, “every spring
this old apple tree I am going to tell you about had the most
beautiful of blossoms. And when midsummer came the apples
that came out on that tree had, somehow, a better taste than the
apples from any other tree. And one day I found out the reason.</p>

<p>“I thought the hammock, which hung under the apple tree, looked
very comfortable, and so I made myself most cozy and happy. It was
not long before I dozed off into a nice little nap, and then I heard what
the apple tree was saying to the little unripe apples on the boughs.</p>

<p>“‘You must grow to be fine and ripe, and you must keep all the little
apple-seeds good and warm so they can be just as brown as brown can
be. That will mean that little boys and little girls can eat all they want,
for so long as the seeds are brown they can never do any harm. And,
you apples, you must be very sure that you turn around and have the sun
warm you and make you bright and red.’</p>

<p>“As the old apple tree was talking, I noticed that the apples just grew
a little bit bigger, and redder and fatter, and looked as they were—oh,
so juicy and wonderful inside. I was certain, too, that the little
seeds were growing browner every minute.</p>

<p>“‘You see,’ he continued, ‘it’s such an honor for us. You know that
on the day we’re ripe the fairy queen brings all the little fairies to admire
us, and they sit on the boughs and wave about with us. And more
than that—you know the apple that is ripe first goes to the fairy queen
and then some more go to the little fairies.’</p>

<p>“The fairies are too kind to take away the apples that real people
like to eat—and so the old apple tree has arranged to have a great
many more that we can’t see—they’re called the apples of fairyland.</p>

<p>“And the tree still went on talking:</p>

<p>“‘I, too, am working hard. I am practising my best bow to make
to the fairy queen when she arrives the first day all the apples are
ripe. So she is to come very, very early in the morning while every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>

I could feel him shining down with all his might—I woke up.</p>

<p>“I moved away from the apple tree then, for it was no longer shady;
the sun had come around and told me to get up! But as I walked
away and saw the apple tree waving around I knew it was practising

<p class="dropcap">“There was once an elephant who got tired of the circus and
wandered off one night when nobody was noticing,” commenced
daddy.</p>

<p>“You see the circus was getting ready to go on to another village to
give a performance and it was late at night. They never thought of an
elephant getting away, but they hadn’t heard Jumbo telling the elephants
of late how exceedingly tired he was of circus life and circus
food and circus parades. He was not only tired of it all but he said he
wanted to be a gentleman.</p>

<p>“The other elephants had asked him what a gentleman was, and this
is what he told them:</p>

<p>“‘I heard two little boys talking of what they were going to be when
they grew up,’ said Jumbo, ‘and one of them said he was going to be an
engineer and build bridges. The other little boy had said he was going
to be a gentleman and do nothing. The first boy thought he was quite
wrong and very silly, but then and there I decided that it would be
beautiful to do nothing.’</p>

<p>“The other elephants had asked Jumbo how an elephant could be a
gentleman, any more than a gentleman could be an elephant, but Jumbo
was determined to lead a lazy life. And you see neither Jumbo nor the
little boy knew what being a gentleman really meant.</p>

<p>“So Jumbo escaped and the next morning Jumbo was in a barnyard,
and as you will never be able to guess the friends he had chosen I’ll
have to tell you. He was playing with a big brown dog, a mother hen
and a whole lot of little chickens.</p>

<p>“Of course, he had to be very careful not to move so as to step on his
new friends, for he knew it would be most impolite and not at all
gentlemanly to step on a friend and crush him! But as he had wanted
to stay quiet and do nothing he was very happy.</p>

<p>“The hen sat proudly on one of his ears, while the little chickens all
sat on his head, and ran races up and down his marvelous trunk. The
dog got up on his back and jumped off and on again and again. Meantime
the elephant was sitting down in the barnyard looking very enormous
and very much out of place.</p>

<p>“Soon the little girl, whose name was Betty, and who lived in the
house beyond the barnyard came running out to give her pets their breakfast.</p>

<p>“At first Betty was somewhat frightened at seeing the big elephant,
but then she felt that if the little chickens were so friendly with him, he
must certainly be friendly.</p>

<p>“The elephant stayed some time with the animals of the barnyard and
with Betty. But one morning bright and early she found Jumbo with
an old ball and bat in his great trunk. He was practising baseball so
he would not be put off the team when he got back to the circus for
he had been planning for some time to return to his first friends.</p>

<p>“Well, this morning he had decided to leave. For late the night before
he had heard the circus he belonged to arriving in the village where
Betty lived.</p>

<p>“‘I’ve had a powerful good time,’ said Jumbo to Betty, ‘but I must
be off. I haven’t done a thing for weeks and if this is what it means
to be a gentleman I’d rather be an elephant—which, of course, is
very easy for me to be—as I am one, don’t you see?’</p>

<p>“Now Betty didn’t understand what the elephant was really saying,
but that afternoon when she went to the circus there she saw Jumbo
in the baseball game, and doing all the tricks better than any other
elephant. He was so delighted at having something to do again that
though Betty missed him, still she was glad he was back where he was
happiest.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day169">JUNE 17: The Story the Oak Tree Told</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">A soft breeze of early summer had been blowing all day. The
leaves were looking so fresh and green and having a beautiful
time in the warm sunshine.</p>

<p>“Well,” began daddy, “I must tell you the story the oak told to the
other trees today.</p>

<p>“The other trees would sometimes sigh, ‘How nice!’ or something
like that, but for the most part they let the oak tree do all the talking.</p>

<p>“It was a very young tree, but it looked as if some day it would
be a fine big oak with spreading branches and great strong roots which
nothing could shake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span></p>

<p>“‘I was one day picked up as a little acorn by a small boy,’ said the
tree.</p>

<p>“‘He carried me around in his pocket for days and days. I spent
all my time sleeping, for his pocket was very dark and I could not stay
awake in it.</p>

<p>“‘One day he happened to notice me especially. He wondered why
he had been carrying me around for so long, for he himself couldn’t
think of any reason why he should want me.</p>

<p>“‘And then he thought he would plant me. So he put me in the
ground and covered me over carefully. He watched to see when
I would come up. When first he saw me sprouting above the ground
I thought he would go mad with delight, for he had really been very
much worried about me. After having planted me he was very anxious
that I should grow up right away. So he was a very happy little boy
when he saw that I was really going to become a tree.</p>

<p>“‘Now he comes every day to look at me and has done so ever
since I was born.</p>

<p>“‘You see it will make me a fine tree to have the pride of that little
boy centered in me.</p>

<p>“‘And what is more, it will make him, I think, grow up to be a fine
man, brave and strong like his tree, for that is what he calls me.</p>

<p>“‘So I feel that we will both help one another, and perhaps some
day when he is an old man he will lead some little boy by the hand
and will tell him of how he planted me and how he tried to grow up
to be strong like his tree, and that will help the little boy, too.</p>

<p>“‘We trees can do a lot of good if we want to. Just think how
nice it will sound to be called a fine old oak, and when we feel proud
of ourselves we can think it is even better that we have helped little
boys to be stronger too.’”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day170">JUNE 18: The Weeds and the Flowers</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“The Elves,” commenced daddy, “were playing in a garden
one morning just at the break of day when all the flowers
were opening their sleepy heads, and the ones which had
not been sleeping were looking about them more brightly than ever.</p>

<p>“‘Good morning, Flowers,’ said the Elves. The flowers nodded
their heads and smiled and waved about in the warm breeze. But the
Elves heard some very strange sounds—not quite like the talk of the
flowers—for to the Elves and Fairies, you know, there is a Flower language,
and a Flower’s way of talking.</p>

<p>“‘What could these other sounds mean?’ they asked each other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span></p>

<p>“‘We’ll tell you,’ said these voices. ‘We’re the Weeds. And
some of us are beautiful, but all of us are strong. Yes, we’re so strong
that no matter how they try to dig us up and throw us away we’re up
again in no time. We’re little fighters—yes, we are. We have our
Army headquarters. Indeed we do! And our Generals are very fine.
They’re the great, tall Weeds you often see, and my, but it’s hard to
get them out of the earth. If they are beaten more Generals take
their places, for the motto of the Weeds is, “We’ll always be strong—there
will always be Weeds.”</p>

<p>“And so they chatted on. The Elves were very much interested,
but still they couldn’t quite see, when the Weeds were doing so much
talking and bragging, how the flowers could smile so happily.</p>

<p>“So they whispered to the Flowers very gently:</p>

<p>“‘Tell us, Flowers, why are you so happy?’</p>

<p>“Then in lovely, soft rustling voices the Flowers said:</p>

<p>“‘We are going to have a Book written about us to-day. Yes, a
real Book, and our pictures are going to be painted. We’re very proud
and happy. We have a Mistress who comes out every morning and
most of the day she is with us. She bends over us and digs up the
earth around us so it is nice and soft and comfortable. And every
evening after Mr. Sun has gone to bed she gives us cool drinks of
water.</p>

<p>“‘It was only yesterday she told us that some Noble Grownup was
going to write a Book about us and call it “The Ideal Garden.” We
think that ideal means something like perfect—anyway it’s something
extremely nice. And she has been making us ready for the Book. Oh,
we’re very proud indeed.’ And then the queer sounds came again,
and the Weeds spoke up:</p>

<p>“‘Yes, and we’re going to have a Chapter about us. We don’t
quite understand yet what a Chapter is—but it’s a great deal—we’re
sure of that. The Grownup told our Mistress that she was going to
say something about pretty Weeds in a garden.’</p>

<p>“‘Well, we like you all—Flowers and Weeds,’ said the Elves.”</p>

one of the orchids and one of the lilies of the valley were talking to

forced into such a great big bouquet to be worn, when a smaller one
would have been so much prettier and nicer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, we are being insulted,” said Mr. Orchid. “She doesn’t care
one scrap for flowers. She just wants to look rich and so she bought
us—and plenty of us, and that is what we call insulting.”</p>

<p>“It most certainly is,” said Miss Lily of the Valley. “No one who
cared for flowers would wear as many as she is crushing together; no,

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day172">JUNE 20: The Colored Bags</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“Since Melly had been a little girl her Auntie had been very
fond of her,” said daddy.</p>

<p>“One day Melly’s aunt was looking over a great box she
had with pieces in it when Melly saw all the odd pieces of silk. ‘I
wonder,’ said Melly’s Auntie, ‘if you would like to have me make you
little bags, so you can carry your purse and your handkerchief in one
when you go shopping, and your handkerchief and other odds and ends
you carry around at other times in other bags? I could make you so
many bags of so many different colors. Some, you see, could be yellow,
some blue, some pink, some gray, some orange, some purple, some tan,
some rose, some green, some white.’</p>

<p>“So that was the way Melly’s bags came about, and her Auntie on
her birthday and Christmas always gave her a few new bags made
from the old silk.</p>

<p>“How gay and pretty they were and how Melly loved them.</p>

<p>“Now one evening Melly had gone to sleep and the bags were talking.</p>

<p>“‘Ah,’ said the bag of pale blue, ‘I’m but a baby. I am only a few
years old.’</p>

<p>“‘And I’m very old,’ said a little plaid bag. ‘I belonged to her
grandmother!’</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ said a purple bag, ‘it does seem funny to see the world
again. It’s nice to be young once more. Why, I was getting so used
to the darkness of the piece box that I blinked, actually blinked—at
least as much as a bag can blink—when I first got out again.’</p>

<p>“‘And isn’t it fun,’ said the green bag, ‘to see so many things? I
went on a picnic yesterday, and a piece of bacon got into me in some
way or other, a nice little crumby piece. Well, I did feel funny. I felt
like a person having breakfast. I must say I didn’t eat it up—I’m not
fond of eating—mostly because I’m without a mouth and a stomach,
but it is fun to go to so many different places and to see what is going
on in different places.’</p>

<p>“‘I’m so glad I was made,’ said the rose bag. ‘I’m going to a
dancing party this afternoon. They’ll have ice-cream there and I’ll<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
hear all the children play and laugh and I’ll hear them say, “Oh, Melly,
which bag have you got with you to-day?” And then I will be shown.’</p>

a second time,’ ended the yellow bag.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day173">JUNE 21: A Spider’s Curiosity</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“They may not think the spider is a curious creature, though
again they may think so,” said Mr. Spider, “for I am sure
I cannot keep track of what they think.</p>

<p>“But last summer I was attracted to a house which looked rather
cool and comfortable and as though the people who lived in it had
gone away and left the blinds down.</p>

<p>“Now when I say I was attracted to the house I mean that the
house looked attractive to me and so I went there. I went in first
through a crack under the door. I looked about me when I got inside
and I thought to myself: ‘Dear me, I have the whole place to myself.’
But I found that a number of spider friends and cousins had come to
the house too.</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ they said, upon seeing me, ‘have you come to this hotel to
board? It’s really quite good. Meals are fine. We’ve found a
number of delicious little creatures to nibble at.’</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ I said, ‘I’ve come to this hotel to board, but I won’t pay
my board.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, won’t you?’ said they.</p>

<p>“‘I will not,’ I answered. ‘I do not pay board. It’s a foolish thing
to do, a waste of time, and besides I haven’t the money. I wouldn’t
pay board for anything, for it spoils people.’</p>

<p>“Yes, they think they can do anything when they charge board.
They can be rude and only give you so much of this and so much of
that, and they have to watch over you to see that you don’t eat more
than you are allowed. At least that is my idea of boarding, though
I suppose for those who have plenty of money it is all right.</p>

<p>“But I have no money, none at all.”</p>

<p>“Neither have I,” said the spider who was listening.</p>

<p>“Therefore I cannot board,” said Mr. Spider.</p>

<p>“Well, as I was saying, my relatives and friends talked to me and
when I said that I wouldn’t pay my board they said: ‘Oh, that is quite
all right, Mr. Spider. None of us do. Besides, we feel sure the people
who have gone away will be glad if they hear that some of the Spider
family are watching over their house in their absence.’</p>

<p>“So I settled down, but after a time I began to feel as though I
would like to be busy. Every one around me was working.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span></p>

<p>“And one day one of the other spiders said to me: ‘Mr. Spider, did
you bring your work?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes indeed,’ I answered, ‘I have it here with me.’</p>

<p>“Then, of course, I thought I would choose a good spinning table
or spinning chair, or some place where I would be comfortable and
cozy a-spinning.</p>

<p>“Just as I was thinking about it I happened to take a look at a telephone
upon a table.</p>

<p>“‘There will I go,’ I said to the others.</p>

<p>“‘But,’ they told me, ‘the telephone is a modern thing and spinning
is an old, old thing to do.’</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ I answered, ‘I will mix the old and the new, I will work
around the modern telephone. I will spin a web so when the people
come back they will have to talk through Spiderland in order to talk
to their friends.’”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“I follow you so that people can tell the time by me,” said the
sun-dial. “And how am I able to tell time for them? All
owing to you. I depend upon you to help me tell the time, for
you cast your shadow over me, and people know just the hour of the
day it is. There is the sun-flower which is named after you,” continued
the sun-dial. “It is so called because it is so bright and golden
and it is big too!”</p>

<p>“That is so,” said the sun. “I am very fond of the sun-flower.”</p>

<p>“And think of all the flowers, like the marigold and the morning-glories,
which open when you arise, and go to sleep, closing their eyes,
when you go to bed.</p>

<p>“Then there is the sunfish, so named because he is round and fat
and supposed to be slightly like the sun in shape.”</p>

<p>“I had never heard the reason for his name before,” said Mr. Sun.
“Thanks for telling me.”</p>

<p>The sun-dial moved a little and so did Mr. Sun, for the time was
going on.</p>

<p>“Then there is the sun-gem,” continued the sun-dial. “He is the
humming-bird, you know, and he has such glorious bright colors that
they have named him after you.”</p>

<p>“I never knew that before,” said Mr. Sun. “How very interesting.
Pray go on.”</p>

<p>“There are the sun opals—beautiful stones—and sun perch—like
the sunfish family. There are sun plants and sun ferns.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span></p>

<p>“Indeed,” beamed the sun.</p>

<p>“And there are sun shades,” continued the sun-dial.</p>

eyes, don’t they?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is so,” said the sun-dial. “Dear me, I didn’t mean to
say anything about sun-shades. And there is sun fever and sun stroke.”</p>

<p>“Oh dear, dear, dear,” said the sun, growing very red and angry.
“They are horrible things people get when their heads ache and they
feel quite miserable.”</p>

<p>The sun was very red and very mad now, and the sun-dial knew
it had said too much. “I am so sorry,” said the sun-dial. “I grew
a little careless in what I was saying.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you did,” agreed the sun. “But no matter; I shall sleep and
forget about it now.”</p>

<p>And the big red sun went to bed behind the hill and the sun-dial
said to itself it would never make such mistakes again!</p>

It might make you more polite.”</p>

manner was not so very polite. But we don’t feel so polite toward
your family. And as for teaching us manners with the aid of a little
nip and a wee bite—well, that is absurd, as we have shells and we
can go right back into them. We may be slow, but we can get into
our shells quickly enough.”</p>

<p>“Yes, cowards,” hissed the Mosquitoes.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” said the Snails. “It’s not cowardly to avoid being
bitten. It wouldn’t help any one if we were bitten. There would be
no good done because of it. We simply do not wish to be bitten and
give you a chance to say:</p>

<p>“‘We bit the Snails to-day. That was part of our pleasure.’ For
it is a pleasure to you to bite, and we don’t intend to help along such
selfish, mean, cross creatures.”</p>

<p>“Then why are you talking to us?” asked the Mosquitoes.</p>

<p>“Because,” said the Snails, “you have just missed a picnic party that
went by here a little time ago. A nice picnic party of children. We
won’t tell you where they went—no, indeed. And you’ve lost them
now. We only talked to you because we wanted you to miss one horrid
adventure. We wouldn’t have wasted our time otherwise. And we
talked slowly to give the children more time.” The Snails wiggled
and squirmed a little. They were very much pleased with themselves.</p>

ugly little songs. They tried to bite the snails, but they had gone

snails were happy! They knew that the children were far away by

<p class="dropcap">“The rose-breasted grosbeak,” said daddy, “is a very useful
bird, and at the same time an extremely beautiful bird.</p>

<p>“Mr. Rose-Breasted Grosbeak wears black and white, with
a handsome vest of rose color and under his wings he has the same
decoration. Mrs. Grosbeak is not so handsome. She wears a brown
frock, and looks not unlike her cousin, Mrs. Sparrow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span></p>

<p>“They have some fine relations, too—there are Mr. and Mrs. Blue
Grosbeak, and there again Mr. Grosbeak is very beautiful. He wears
a deep blue suit and his shoulders are trimmed with chestnut-colored
feathers. Mrs. Grosbeak is of grayish brown and grayish white,
having the top side of the first color, and the bottom side of the
second color.</p>

<p>“Then there are the Evening Grosbeak family. Mrs. Evening Grosbeak
is paler than her husband but their coloring is not so different
from each other as in the other members of the Grosbeak family.
The Evening Grosbeaks are of brown and yellow with touches of very
dark brown and white-tipped wings.</p>

<p>“And we mustn’t forget the Pine Grosbeak family. Mr. Pine Grosbeak
is of a wonderful shade of red, while Mrs. Grosbeak is yellow
and gray in her coloring.</p>

<p>“The Pine Grosbeaks are fond of the winter; they are not afraid of
the cold. In fact, they are not afraid of anything and they trust people
and let them come close to them. They have low, warbling voices
and whistle in a beautiful, clear fashion.</p>

<p>“The Evening Grosbeaks have very large bills and eat many seeds,
berries and insects, as you may imagine. But they can sing and whistle,
too.</p>

<p>“The Blue Grosbeak family sing, too, in a nice warbling fashion of
their own, which is a little like the song Mr. Indigo Bunting sings, but
Mr. Grosbeak’s is a little stronger and louder—a little more of a song.
They probably like to sing songs that are somewhat the same, as they
are both blue birds and so have the same taste in color and in music.</p>

<p>“But it is of Mr. Rose-Breasted Grosbeak that I want to tell you, for
he is not only beautiful, but, as I said, he is very useful.</p>

<p>“And he can sing, too! Oh, how Mr. Rose-Breasted Grosbeak
can sing! He chirps in low, deep and lovely tones and he sings
from morning to night in the most glorious manner.</p>

<p>“But he does a great deal else beside singing. He helps the farmer
and the owner of the orchard.</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ said a Mr. Rose-Breasted Grosbeak to his mate, many, many
years ago, ‘I am not going to be satisfied just to be beautiful and to
have a nice voice.’</p>

<p>“‘What is it you want to do?’ asked Mrs. Rose-Breasted Grosbeak.</p>

<p>“‘I will have to think about it a little,’ he answered. And then after
he had thought a time he said,</p>

<p>“‘I have it.’</p>

<p>“‘Tell me,’ chirped Mrs. Rose-Breasted Grosbeak.</p>

<p>“‘We will help the farmer and the owner of the orchard. We will
destroy bad bugs and insects which would hurt the crop. We can easily
change our diet so that these things will taste delicious to us. And we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
will be doing some good work, too. It’s horrible to be lazy and beautiful
and rich and superior. It’s much more interesting to be busy and see
things finished that we’ve done ourselves.’</p>

<p>“Mrs. Rose-Breasted Grosbeak agreed, and thought they would enjoy
life a great deal more by being busy.</p>

<p>“‘It would be so tiresome,’ Mrs. Grosbeak told her mate some time
after this, ‘if we did nothing all day but sing. Why, we’d have nothing
to sing about after a time, no joyous news to tell the world!’</p>

<p>“And so from that day to this, the Rose-Breasted Grosbeak family
have been a great help. They eat caterpillars which would destroy
trees, many moths, bugs, worms, and insects which would hurt growing
vegetables and trees bearing fruits.</p>

<p>“They eat cucumber beetles, too, but mostly they eat potato-bugs.
And so they are a great, great help, and are often called ‘Those dear
little Grosbeak birds!’”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day179">JUNE 27: The Pigeons’ Bath</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“Now the four pigeons I want to tell you about were a daddy
and mother pigeon, and their little pigeon children whose
names were Peter Pigeon and Polly Pigeon,” said daddy.
“And I saw them to-day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span></p>

<p>“‘Polly,’ said her mother, ‘be sure you wet your feathers. Now a
good shake! There, that’s the way!’ And then the mother pigeon
would give herself a good shaking in the water to explain.</p>

<p>“And Daddy Pigeon was saying to Peter, ‘There, Peter! That’s the
way. Don’t be afraid of the water. A bath will do you good. And
the day is warm, the sun is shining, and we’ll get good and warm after
this. Our feathers will be warm in no time!’</p>

<p>“Now, Peter and Polly Pigeon were being told just how to bathe in
the best way by their fond parents. But it was not hard for them to
learn. They had lots of fun spattering each other, and they played
all sorts of games. And after they were really through bathing and
had shaken their feathers they began to get dry in the hot sun.</p>

<p>“Polly and Peter Pigeon were quite sleepy, after their playing, bathing,
splashing and spattering, and they began to coo very softly before
going to sleep. But as they were just dozing off Mother Pigeon said:</p>

<p>“‘If we’re all good pigeons, the Fairy Queen, who looks after pigeons,
too, will come and whisper in the ears of children to give us bread
crumbs. She will tell them that in the hot days of summer we like
little cooling drinks which they can put in pans and saucers around their
yards and on their porches. Yes, the Fairy Queen will tell them all
that, if we’re good pigeons.’</p>

<p>“Of course Polly and Peter made up their minds they would be
very good indeed so as to receive the rewards about which the Fairy
Queen would whisper to the children. And in case she hasn’t already
told you I want to let you know that it will make her happy to think of
children all over the world, when the warm weather comes, thinking of
the little creatures who can’t turn on the faucet and get a good cool
drink of water, but who must wait for the rain or kind people.”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“It had been the first hot day. Even the sun felt tired. That may
sound very strange, to think of the sun feeling tired,” said daddy.
“But still can’t you imagine that on the first hot day that comes,
when the sun has been shining with all his might and main he gets a little
bit tired and is glad when it is time to go to bed? Many strong people
may get tired at night.</p>

<p>“As the sun went to bed, the moon began to peep up and laugh. He
grinned from ear to ear, for he said to himself:</p>

<p>“‘To-night I really will be appreciated, for the sun has overworked
to-day and no one ever gets any thanks for overworking. It is as bad
as not working enough.’</p>

<p>“Of course, the moon was the very sort to talk that way. For, can
you imagine that jolly old man whom you see grinning at you so often
as ever really working very hard?</p>

<p>“Just then the moon began sending out his invitations for a party.</p>

<p>“He sent them in this way: he whispered to the tall pines that he
wanted to have a party and to invite all the little fairies. Also he
added that they must wear their very best clothes, for when he gave
a party he liked to see folks in their party clothes.</p>

<p>“The fairy queen was dressed in glittering gold. She wore a gold
crown on her head and carried a gold wand with gold stars glittering
from it.</p>

<p>“All the other fairies were dressed in silvery costumes, for the man in
the moon is very fond of silver. You will sometimes notice that he puts
on a silver robe himself, and he is very friendly with the silver clouds
that float in the sky at night.</p>

<p>“They did have the very best time, and they all enjoyed the party so,
so much. The man in the moon laughed his head off—at least the
fairies were afraid he would—as he said he had never before seen the
pine trees behave so like silly little trees, instead of like big, dignified
trees they had always prided themselves on being.</p>

<p>“But the pine trees didn’t care, for they were having a beautiful time
waving and singing. They sang for lots of the lovely dances the fairies
did. As for the fairies, they felt it was a very great honor for them to
be given a party by the wonderful old man in the moon, who had
such splendid guests as the pine trees!”</p>

was so fat was because he ate everything he wanted. He used
to spend every penny he ever got all on himself, and he always
bought candy.</p>

<p>“When supper time came he really made himself very sick over jam,
for he always persisted in eating loads and loads of jam and would not
even spread it on his toast, but would eat it plain out of a spoon.</p>

<p>“One afternoon he went to a party. He was very disagreeable and
wouldn’t play any games at all. He simply sat in a corner and waited
until supper time came. Then he ate all the ice-cream, all the candy
and all the cake that he could get hold of. None of the other children
went near him, for they didn’t care about a little boy who only cared
about eating all the time.</p>

<p>“That night Billy felt very sick when he went to bed. But he soon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
fell asleep. In his sleep, though, a great horned dragon appeared and
said to him:</p>

aren’t nearly so dreadful as we’re made out to be. We take a great
interest in children, and I am going to take a great interest in you.</p>

<p>“‘Before you made such a little—yes, I must say it—a little piggie-wig
of yourself you were a very nice little boy. But now you’re fat
and lazy. So every night I shall chase you around in your dreams until
you give up eating so much jam and candy and until you once more
enjoy playing around with the other little boys and girls.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, please don’t!’ said Billy, who was terrified.</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ said the dragon; ‘I’m a good friend of yours, and I shall
make you a real boy again. In a few weeks you really won’t know
yourself.’</p>

<p>“With that he was gone, but he kept his word, and every night chased
Billy around in his dreams until he gave up eating so many sweets and
played games and became a real boy again.”</p>

<p>Jack and Evelyn looked very much pleased. They loved to hear
about other children, especially of boys and girls about their own ages.</p>

<p>“Worthington was unlike some brothers, but he was like you in this
way, Jack; he liked to play with his sister. His sister liked, too, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
play with him. He never frightened her, but he showed her how to
do things, and she was never afraid when she was with him. In the
fall he took her for rides in her express-cart, and he made a high seat
in the cart for her when he took her for slower and more stylish rides.</p>

<p>“He taught her to climb trees and to swim and to do tricks on the
trapeze. And she, too, used to play in the snowball fights, back in
the forts which he and the other boys would make.</p>

<p>“Well, it was summer, and Worthington was not going to school.
He thought and he thought and he thought, and finally he said:</p>

out the whole scheme in his head, and the next day he went to his
aunt who owned a garden, and he said:</p>

<p>“‘This summer,’ he began, ‘I could hoe the beans in your garden,
and I could weed the garden paths. I could water the flowers every
night, and do all the weeding, in fact. You wouldn’t need to have a
man do the work, except one day a week to do the heavy things. And
then I thought I could give Mimmie a present of skates and boots out
of my own money in the fall.’ And Auntie engaged him as an assistant
gardener then and there.”</p>

‘We shall have motor-cars and we shall have airplanes to fly in.
We shall have quantities of people to give orders to. We’ll never have
to tidy our rooms, and we’ll never have to run errands.’ So they began
to play.</p>

<p>“Three other children said, ‘Let’s be very famous. We shall have
all the people in the world swarm around us as the bees do around
the flowers for the honey. They shall say how fine we are, how brave
we are, and how noble. They’ll put up monuments to us.’</p>

<p>“And still three other children wanted to play. ‘We want to play
that we have a few animals. They are such fun! More fun than
anything. And if we treat them right we’ll be loved so much. Yes,
we shall play we have two dogs and a little pony.’</p>

<p>“Now the Dream-King was sitting on a throne made of silver threads
so beautifully woven that they held together and gave him the most
wonderful of thrones. Over his head were little boys and girls flying
about, and there were Fairies, Gnomes, Elves, Brownies. And that
night the Dream-King sent dreams to these children. They all had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
their play-games made real in their dreams. The two children who
wanted to play they were very rich, dreamed they were rich, but oh,
how they hated it! All around them were butlers and servants in
wonderful liveries. And they had great motor-cars which were driven
by quiet, stiff persons who wouldn’t answer questions. They felt
as if they owned absolutely nothing at all, for everything was taken
care of by some one else. They weren’t allowed to play and get the
least little scrap dirty, for they had to wear such wonderful clothes!
Oh, it was a very miserable dream.</p>

<p>“The children who wanted to be very famous dreamed they were
surrounded by people who never let them move so they could play.
They saw a monument put up in a park with their names written in
stone. But the monument was too big to play with.</p>

<p>“The children with the dogs and the pony were having the most
gorgeous dream. They were taking such care of their pets and the
animals loved them so.</p>

<p>“But at last the Dream-King left them, and they awoke suddenly.</p>

riches and fame were very, very dull.”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">The Fourth of July had passed and Jack and Evelyn were
still very tired, but daddy had a story to tell them, a really
true story, and, of course, they were very eager to hear it.</p>

<p>“There was a dog once named Dash. He was an Irish setter, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
he belonged to an army family. His master was a young lieutenant in
the army, and his master’s father was a general.</p>

<p>“Now, this dog was quite old, but he had led an active life which had
agreed with him splendidly, and he didn’t behave as if he were old
at all. There were several young children in the family, and he was
made a great pet. What he liked above everything was the sound of
guns.</p>

<p>“He had been to numerous army posts, and each one seemed to him
to be quite perfect, especially on the days of target practise or when the
salutes were fired.</p>

<p>“But, alas, one summer the family went to live in a stupid, quiet
little village, where there was absolutely no life at all.</p>

<p>“Dash seemed to be pining away in the village. Quiet country life
didn’t agree with this dog of the army. The family thought that maybe
Dash was going to die of old age until one day came—the day of
joy to so many thousands of people! And it was the day for Dash.
‘Could it be true?’ he thought to himself when he first heard the sound
of a huge dynamite cracker. Then came another. With a bound Dash
was out of his corner, wide awake and barking furiously. There was
no more sleep for that household that night, but little did they care,
for all wished to enter into the celebration.</p>

<p>“Late in the day the young lieutenant said to a friend of his: ‘Let’s
go off to the river. I have several cannon fire-crackers to send off. I
didn’t dare to fire them to-day, as I was afraid they might break the
windows. But we can throw them over the bridge. Dash has gone
to have his supper and is somewhat calmed down.’</p>

<p>“So off they started for the river, and over the bridge they threw a
lighted cannon cracker. Just before it landed in the water off it went
with a terrific report.</p>

<p>“They had lighted the other and thrown it into the water when Dash
went bounding into the river, swimming toward the awful firecracker.
These crackers had been recommended as ‘sure to go off,’ and there
was the beloved Dash going for it.</p>

<p>“But the firecracker did not go off! Dash sniffed at it disgustedly,
while his master breathed the biggest sigh of relief and thanks of his
life.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day190">JULY 8: The Big Tent</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“This story,” said daddy, “is to be about Peter Gnome’s circus.</p>

<p>“‘This way to the Big Tent! This way to the Big Tent!’
he called. Over and over again he kept saying it until
finally he had enough little creatures following him to fill as big a Tent
as ever you’ve seen.</p>

<p>“At last he stopped, and there every one saw an enormous tent made
out of birch bark and moss. Inside there were seats made of old trees,
and there were also Reserved Seats of old pieces of trees covered with
moss. Most of the Fairies took Reserved Seats.</p>

<p>“And there were poles to keep the tent up. Some of the Spiders
and Caterpillars who had followed along climbed up the poles. For
they said they might miss a great many sights if they stayed on the
ground, but if they were high up they would see everything that was
going on.</p>

<p>“Then the circus began. And such a circus as it was. The Gnomes
had certainly practised some very fine tricks, and the way they dashed
about the ring in the center of the tent, and the way they turned somersaults
and did tricks, made the Brownies and Elves and Fairies delighted
beyond words that they had been invited.</p>

<p>“But when all the tricks were over, and all the little creatures thought
it was time to leave, out came Peter Gnome and stood on the platform
made of a toadstool in the center of the ring.</p>

<p>“‘Ladies and Gentlemen,’ said Peter Gnome—for he had heard that
was what they were called in the real circus tents—‘I want to take up
a few minutes of your time.’</p>

<p>“‘It’s not our time any more than any one else’s,’ interrupted one
of the Snails who had come in late.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span></p>

<p>“‘Well,’ continued Peter Gnome, ‘for a little while I wish to talk
to you. And this is what I want to say. After this circus there will
be a concert—one of the finest concerts ever heard. And in addition
to that there will be a Side Show where will be seen the Bearded Lady
and the Tallest Man living. All keep your seats and one of the
Gnomes will be around to collect from you the extra payment of two
stems of grass.’</p>

<p>“All of the Fairies and the rest of the audience laughed when Peter
Gnome said that. For well they knew he didn’t want any payment for
the concert and Side Show, but that he thought it would be so much
more fun to have a Gnome go around and make believe to collect it.”</p>

<p>“Who was the tallest man?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“Old Mr. Giant,” said daddy. “He had been made to come just
this once, and he did enjoy being made such a fuss of. The only thing
he didn’t like so much was when some of the Spiders crawled up his
great long legs and tickled him a little. But soon they stopped when
they saw he didn’t like it and began weaving webs instead.</p>

<p>“‘All right,’ said Mr. Giant. ‘Make all the homes you like. I’ll
carry you to my Cave when I go, and you can have your homes there.’
The Spiders, of course, were delighted.</p>

<p>“And the Bearded Lady turned out to be none other than Peter
Gnome himself—dressed in a fine gown of oak leaves and wearing over
his face a mask made out of the roots of trees!”</p>

worry because they’re irregular. I’m not so vain as to long for regular
teeth.</p>

to act that way. That’s better than having white even teeth.</p>

<p>“I live in the water and there I go and look for my food. I don’t
go into silly shops and to market as ladies do.</p>

<p>“But there is just one thing I feel in sympathy with ladies about—at
least all ladies who are loving mothers—I can understand what
it means to have a baby look at its mother out of its lovely baby eyes
which are as beautiful as anything in the world. And I can see its
love for its mother, and oh, my whole heart goes out with love for
it.</p>

<p>“Yes, sometimes when you see the great old ugly hippopotamus you
must not only think of the ugliness but you must say, ‘Back of that thick
hide, behind that awful jaw and those hideous features, deep down in

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day192">JULY 10: The Papoose</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“IN a quaint old city,” said daddy, “Indians come into town every
Saturday morning with bright-colored baskets and beaded moccasins.
They make these things and they make beaded bags and purses and
little ornaments.</p>

<p>“They drive oxen instead of horses and the oxen move as slowly as
if they did not care in the least if they ever got anywhere at all!</p>

<p>“The Indian women, or squaws as they are called, carry large baskets
upon their heads in which are the things they have to sell, smaller
baskets, purses and moccasins.</p>

<p>“Sometimes, too, they bring into the town flowers in the summer and
in the autumn red berries—for they have a little village of their own
out in the country. They are not wild at all and they would not dream
of hurting any one.</p>

<p>“One day a little girl named Olive was sitting in her room reading
when she heard the front door bell ring. She went downstairs and
there was a little Indian girl, not any older than herself.</p>

<p>“‘Will the beautiful lady buy pretty basket?’ asked the little Indian
girl.</p>

<p>“Olive was so pleased! She was not nearly big enough to be called<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
‘lady,’ for she was still very young, and she knew quite well that she
was not beautiful at all. She had freckles and a very big mouth,
and she had only a little hair which was quite straight. And she was
tall for her age and much too thin. But she had never been called
beautiful before and though she knew the little Indian girl was quite
wrong, still she was delighted.</p>

<p>“‘You are beautiful yourself,’ said Olive. For the Indian girl
had long black hair and enormous dark eyes, wonderful dark skin
with quite a good deal of color.</p>

<p>“‘Me beautiful?’ she asked. ‘Oh no, me not beautiful at all.’</p>

<p>“They each thought the other beautiful because each was so different.</p>

<p>“Olive bought some baskets for her mother and a little beaded purse
for herself and then she said to the little Indian girl:</p>

<p>“‘Won’t you have some cocoa with me?’ The little Indian girl
nodded her head and said: ‘Me like goodies!’</p>

<p>“So Olive and the little Indian girl went into Olive’s room and had
a fine feast, using blue cups and saucers and eating bread and butter
from little blue plates.</p>

<p>“‘Me tell you story?’ asked the little Indian girl. Olive was delighted.</p>

<p>“‘Please,’ she said. And the little Indian girl began:</p>

<p>“‘My brudder, he very big man. He tall and strong and plenty
muscle he has.’ She bent her arms to show what she meant by muscle
and she stood up with her arms above her to show how tall he was.
‘He build a boat,’ she went on, ‘a red boat—a canoe—and he take it
along water so it never make a sound. He know how to paddle so!
Never a sound!</p>

<p>“‘We have a river by our hut and he keep the boat by the bank,
tied to an old tree. He take us all out in it, but what do you suppose
he call that boat?’</p>

<p>“Olive couldn’t guess. She tried many names she thought the boat
might be called, but they were all wrong. ‘Tell me,’ she begged.</p>

<p>“‘My brudder, he not call his boat after great strong man, or after
warrior or hero; no, he call boat after our little baby brudder—what
mudder call the little wee one. He call his boat the Papoose which
mean an Indian baby—and he mean our baby. His boat which can
go out into the big waves and not upset—which is so strong, like my
brudder—it is named the Papoose after the baby!’ Her eyes were
dancing with joy but it was time for her to be off.</p>

<p>“She put her basket on top of her head and started off. ‘Will your
fadder bring you to see the big Papoose and the little Papoose?’ she
asked as she left, and to Olive’s great delight her mother called out:</p>

<p>“‘We will take you some time.’ And both little girls left each other
smiling and happy.”</p>

<p class="dropcap">“I am going to tell you about Mr. Gray Mouse’s feast,” said
daddy. “There were biscuits of all sorts and soft cream
cheese—such cheese as mice had never had before. Their
mouths and paws were covered with it, and one of the little children
mice said:</p>

<p>“‘Let’s not wipe off our whiskers. We can do that later on when
we may be getting hungry again—perhaps after we’re in bed.’ So all
the children mice had very sticky mouths and whiskers. But the big
mice said:</p>

<p>“‘Let the children have a good time, for this is a real party.’ And
Mr. Gray Mouse was very much pleased that all his guests were having
such a good time.</p>

<p>“When the party was over and it was time to go home, Mr. LongTail
Mouse said: ‘I’m getting tired of our present home. Let’s all
have a change. I have been looking at new homes for a little time to be
ready in case we ever wanted to move, and I know of a fine one.’</p>

<p>“‘Let’s go,’ said Grandpa Gray Mouse. ‘I never believe in living in
one home too long. That’s why I’m such an old mouse, and have lived
so much longer than most. I keep changing homes—and I fool the
cats!’</p>

<p>“So all the mice went to a new home—for they knew in a short time
after the feast they had just had that a cat would be invited to the
house to live!”</p>

places, lovely flowers grow up and are proud and happy as they hear
people going by in their automobiles or carriages or walking, exclaiming
how wonderful they are.</p>

<p>“Now and again, some little flower turns to one side in the wrong way
and it has a bad dream, and then when it wakes up it is not lovely like
its brothers or sisters. But that seldom happens. And so, you see,
flowers know about sweet dreams—all owing to the Fairy Queen.”</p>

do some work too,’ they said.</p>

<p>“‘Well, let’s blow about a little and find something.’</p>

<p>“Pretty soon they passed by a window of an office. There were a
great many papers lying about on the desks and as one of the little
Breeze Children said:</p>

<p>“‘There doesn’t seem to be much to do here,’ the papers began to
blow this way and that.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, let’s blow papers,’ they shouted as they saw what had happened.
And all that day they went about from window to window
blowing all the papers they could find. Such a time they had!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day197">JULY 15: The Coral Families</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“Why aren’t we called coral insects any more, mother?” asked
the small coral polyp. Coral is a hard substance used
for jewelry and ornaments, you know.</p>

<p>“Because, my dear,” said the mother, “you are a kind of animal,
and not insect. It is incorrect to call you an insect, just as it would
be wrong to call me one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span></p>

<p>“But somehow,” said the coral polyp, “I would rather be called
an insect than a polyp. A polyp doesn’t seem to mean much.”</p>

<p>“It means what you are,” said his mother. “But perhaps that
doesn’t mean much. We aren’t big enough to think of what we are
called. We just belong to a big group and you and I have grown
friendly. That is why you call me mother polyp. But maybe I am
your mother polyp after all. It really is too much trouble to think
about. We have beautiful homes and so have all the members of our
family. Just think, we have an island named after our homes. It is
called Coral Island.</p>

<p>“Oh, I do feel so sorry for those who live in wooden houses and in
brick houses. How ugly their homes are. Think of wood and brick
compared to coral. Now we live and get all our support from our
coral homes. And think how wonderful they are? Some are of red
coral and some of pink, but all are beautiful.</p>

<p>“Yes, the more I think of it, the more I’m sorry for the creatures
who live in houses of wood or brick, ground holes or rough nests.</p>

<p>“Besides, it is so much finer to have a home on the water—a coast
home is far nicer than an inland home.”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose,” said the young polyp, “that it all depends on how
one looks at it.”</p>

<p>“I look at it from the standpoint of a polyp,” said the mother polyp
proudly.</p>

<p>“To be sure we are wonderful to have such homes,” said the young
polyp. “And still finer than that is the fact that we have a shoemaker
in the family.”</p>

<p>“What?” asked mother polyp.</p>

<p>“To be sure,” said the young polyp. “There is the coral shoemaker,
and he is a relation.”</p>

<p>“That’s so, that’s so,” said the mother polyp. “But of course we
don’t wear shoes, and so he isn’t of much use.”</p>

<p>“That’s true,” said the young polyp, “but it is always useful to have
one in the family. And it sounds so businesslike to speak of Cousin
Coral Shoemaker.”</p>

<p>For there is a little creature with just that name and he is a cousin
of our friends who live in the coral reefs.</p>

<p>And no wonder the coral families boast and brag of the homes they
live in, for very few of us could even dream of living in a jeweled home.
But after all, for people and animals a coral reef would be very uncomfortable,
and besides people and animals have so very much more sense!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day198">JULY 16: The Garden Tools</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“It’s great fun to be a rake,” said the rake, “and to make everything
look nice and tidy. And in the autumn it is such fun raking
up all the leaves and getting ready for the big bonfires.</p>

<p>“It is fun, too, to rake the freshly mown grass and to make everything
smooth and nice.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but it is such fun to be a trowel,” said the trowel, “and to dig
around the garden flowers and to make them grow. They like to be
made all nice and comfy, to have the dirt loosened about them to
give them a little breathing space.</p>

<p>“They don’t like too much! They want to be held in the earth
firmly but with soft, nicely pressed earth about them. And our family
attends to that.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but it is nice to be a hoe,” said the hoe, “for I can do such a
great deal of work. Just take the work I do with string-beans alone.</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose there could be any string-beans if it weren’t for me.
I do such a great deal with the string-beans. I keep them cheerful. I
pay them some attention. I make them feel like growing up into nice
vegetables. I hoe all about them.”</p>

<p>“But think of all the help I am when any one wants to transplant
anything,” said the trowel. “I can dig up the root so that plenty
of its dirt comes up with it. Plants don’t like to leave all their soil
behind; they like to take a little of it along with them, just as people do
when they’re going away for the summer—they like to take along with
them some of their photographs and little odds and ends, some of the
things near and dear to them.”</p>

<p>“It is the same way with the plants and I help to make that possible.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the lawn-mower, “I like to make the lawn and the
terraces look nice and I do make them look so neat. I’m the lawn’s
barber, I am!”</p>

<p>All the other garden tools moved about and laughed in their funny
tool way at the joke the lawn-mower had tried to crack.</p>

<p>“Pretty good, pretty good,” they said.</p>

<p>“And a garden fork like me,” said the garden fork, “can do a good
deal of work too. I like to do my share.”</p>

<p>“We can do a good deal,” said several balls of string. “We keep
things from falling down and we give them a little help and encouragement.”</p>

<p>“So do we,” said some little sticks up which some plants were climbing.</p>

<p>“We try to do our part,” said a little two-pronged fork and a shovel
together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span></p>

<p>A two-pronged fork is a fork with two prongs instead of three or
four as a fork usually has, you will notice.</p>

<p>“But I feel as if I were a great deal of help these days,” said the
hoe, “just when those string-beans need so much attention.”</p>

<p>“And I must thin out some of the flowers,” said the trowel. “Some
of them are growing so closely together that they won’t live that way
and so I am going to separate them and put them in other beds.”</p>

<p>“And you will need my help, too,” said the watering pot, “not to
mention the water!”</p>

<p>“That is so,” said the trowel. “But I have a great deal of important
weeding to do.”</p>

<p>“And I will have to rake up the weeds that you have dug up in the
garden path,” said the rake, “or things won’t look tidy and neat.”</p>

<p>“And I must water all the flowers for there hasn’t been any rain in
some time and it’s up to me to do a great deal of work,” said the
watering pot.</p>

<p>“I really think,” said the rake, “that we are all useful. We all help
the one who owns the garden. Yes, every one of us helps.</p>

<p>“We must all work, each do his part, for each one is needed for
something or other.”</p>

<p>“You’re right,” said the hoe; “none of us should boast alone. We
should all work together for the good of the garden and for the good
of the flowers. Then we will each be doing more, for when creatures
and things work together and don’t waste time boasting and arguing
then a lot gets finished.”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“All the dust in the world belongs to the Family of the Dust
Brothers—just as every little Toad or Frog belongs to the
Toad or Frog family,” said daddy. “One day not long ago,
a group of the Dust Brothers had moved to all the window sills in a
little house they thought was very nice. Some of them had chosen to
hide behind pictures, and under chairs, and on the glass mirrors. The
ones who hid on the glass mirrors thought they would have lots of
fun because folks could not see themselves so plainly—and then they
would see the new-comers to the mirrors. Not, of course, that it was
the first time any of them had ever made mirrors their homes—but
they hadn’t been back since the last dusting day.</p>

<p>“The best friend of the Dust Brothers when they are wide awake
is old Mr. Sun. Then they can all be seen by the lady of the house
and what fun it is for them to be scolded at and to dash off again—only
to come back whenever they feel like it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span></p>

<p>“When they have moved to a new home and are tired and sleepy
the dark clouds are their friends, and Mr. Rain; for then it is so dark
they can’t be seen and they have a good old sleep.</p>

<p>“But yesterday when the Dust Brothers were having such a frolic
it was a beautiful day. Mr. Sun had just decided it was getting up
time—and he had dressed slowly and with great care so he would
look very fine and stylish.</p>

<p>“As he was ready to peep in the windows to see what was going on
he saw a lot of little Gnomes perched all around talking to the Dust
Brothers.</p>

<p>“‘Why is it,’ asked Peter Gnome, ‘that you are so anxious to live
where you know you’ll be sent away again? Why don’t you choose
some home where you can stay?’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, Peter,’ they cried in shocked whispers, ‘you don’t understand
us. You truly don’t.’ And if they could have cried without drowning
themselves I am sure they would have—for they sounded very sad
for a minute. But then they became happy again for they explained
it all to Peter Gnome.</p>

<p>“‘You see,’ they continued, ‘if we live somewhere and are not driven
away too many of the Family come to join us—and it’s more fun to
have lots and lots of homes than a few big ones for all of us. It
would make us have a life like a hotel—ah no, we must have a home
life—just a few of us living together at a time. Of course, we don’t
take up much room, so more of us can live together than most folks.</p>

<p>“‘And as for wanting to have our adventures any different—dear
me—we wouldn’t change for all the world. We can tease and tease
and tease those big grown-ups with their brooms and dusters. Hurrah,
hurrah, what merry lives we lead.</p>

<p>“‘And now, Mr. Sun,’ they said, ‘shine for all you’re worth—so
the grown-ups will see us. Then we’ll be off for a scamper.’</p>

<p>“Sure enough, Mr. Sun did just as the Dust Brothers had asked him
to, and as the Gnomes were rushing off to call on their old friend Mr.
Giant, they heard the Dust Brothers laughing and saying,</p>

the meadow fritillary family.”</p>

<p>“Oh, gracious, daddy!” exclaimed Jack. “Now really!”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Evelyn, “at least I understand it has something to do
with a meadow, but it may be a flower, fruit, animal or bird for all
I know.”</p>

<p>“None of those,” said daddy laughing. “Guess again.”</p>

<p>“Well, it might be the name of a big rock,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“Wrong,” said daddy. Both the children laughed and started to
think of some other creatures and objects which might be in a meadow.</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Evelyn, “there are the meadow larks, but they
are birds, and daddy said these fritillaries aren’t birds.” Evelyn had
a very hard time calling them by their name and Jack said admiringly:
“Well, Evelyn, I wouldn’t dare try that!”</p>

<p>“There are meadow crickets,” said Evelyn.</p>

<p>“Now, we’re coming a little bit closer,” said daddy.</p>

<p>“Oh, do tell us,” urged Jack.</p>

<p>“The meadow fritillaries,” said daddy, “are butterflies!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span></p>

<p>“Gracious,” said Evelyn, “that’s a pretty hard name for a little butterfly
to carry.”</p>

<p>“They have cousins named the Silver-Spot Fritillary family and the
Gulf Fritillary family, but it is of the meadow ones I am going to tell
you, and I think it would be easier for us to speak of them as the
Meadow family and leave out their long last name.</p>

<p>“Mother Meadow had become a butterfly in June and after four
weeks had gone by she laid her little eggs, and in another week there
were little caterpillars. After that Mother Meadow knew there would
be butterflies; and it would take a month for them to become chrysalides
and another week for them to become full-fledged butterflies. So
Mother Meadow was much excited.</p>

<p>“And after a time there would be more butterflies and she would be
a grandmother, and still more and she would be a great-grandmother.
All that would happen in a summer. And there would be still others
but they wouldn’t become full-grown until another spring came around.
They would stop feeding and sleep throughout the winter as many
butterflies will do.</p>

<p>“The latest children of the Meadow Fritillary family in September
feed upon the leaves of violets which they think are particularly delicious.</p>

<p>“When it gets cold ahead of time in the autumn the little half-grown
butterflies go right to sleep and don’t bother about food, but when the
next spring comes they make up for it and eat twice as much.</p>

<p>“Mother Meadow lives in the lowland meadows and near swamps.
She loves a home near the spots where blue and white and purple violets
grow, for she knows her children love the sweet leaves.</p>

<p>“The Meadow family also takes honey from mint and other plants
that grow near the swamps.</p>

<p>“‘Our cousins,’ said Mother Meadow to her brood one day, ‘are
very much like us except for the row of silver spots which line their
wings. That is why they are called the Silver-Bordered Fritillary
family. But we are nice brown speckled butterflies and are as happy
as our handsome cousins.’</p>

<p>“‘Have we any more cousins?’ asked the Meadow children butterflies.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, yes,’ said Mother Meadow, ‘there are the Silver-Spot Fritillaries,
the Great Spangled Fritillaries and the Regal Fritillaries as
well as different kinds of the silver variety. But we are just as happy
and contented as any of them, even if we are rather plain and dull and
brown for butterflies.</p>

<p>“‘And, my children, you rested on violet leaves when you were little
eggs. Some of you rested on the stems of the violet plants, but most
of you were right on the beautiful green leaves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span></p>

<p>“‘So though we’re rather simple little butterflies, we mothers gave
you beds fit for princesses.’</p>

the warm summer sunshine.”</p>

never go to sleep when suddenly a little Goblin hopped on his window
sill, peeped around the curtain, and said:</p>

<p>“‘Good evening. May I come in?’</p>

<p>“‘Who are you?’ asked George.</p>

<p>“‘I am the Goblin who looks after little sick boys—when they have
your kind of sickness. The only trouble is that I can’t see half the
little boys I want to—for I can only go at night-time when they’re
sleeping, and there isn’t time for my rounds. I do believe I shall have
to get some Assistant Workers,’ and the Goblin looked puzzled.</p>

<p>“‘You’re a Goblin?’ gasped George.</p>

<p>“‘To be sure,’ said the Goblin.</p>

<p>“‘Why,’ continued George, ‘I thought they were terrible looking
creatures.’</p>

<p>“‘Ha, ha,’ laughed the Goblin. ‘You make just the same mistake
that so many boys and girls do. You see I am not terrible at all. In
fact, I am very nice and I cure little boys and girls of their pains.’</p>

<p>“‘Are you a Doctor Goblin, then?’ laughed George.</p>

<p>“‘No,’ smiled the Goblin. ‘Doctors and I really need have nothing
to do with each other. Doctors should only be called in when little
girls and boys are really, really sick and not when they’re only pretending.’</p>

<p>“‘I’m not pretending,’ said George, almost in tears. ‘I feel just
as sick as can be.’</p>

<p>“‘Nothing to brag about, is it?’ asked the Goblin.</p>

<p>“‘No-o,’ said George.</p>

<p>“‘And why are you sick?’ asked the Goblin.</p>

<p>“‘I don’t know,’ said George. For surely, he thought to himself,
the Goblin couldn’t know what he had been doing in the daytime—and
George did know, perfectly well, why he was sick.</p>

<p>“‘Did you enjoy those candies?’ asked the Goblin, and George looked
quite uneasy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span></p>

<p>“‘I don’t know,’ said George.</p>

<p>“‘I suppose it is hard to make up your mind now whether you liked
them or not—since they have made you sick.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh dear, oh dear,’ cried George, who had thought he was going
to have fun with the Goblin, and he hid his head under the bedclothes
in shame.</p>

<p>“‘You see,’ continued the Goblin, ‘you were getting into the habit
of really making a little piggie of yourself! You were getting too fat
and lazy. You didn’t like to play ball with the boys nearly so much
as you once did. Isn’t that true?’ And George, who had stuck his
head out of the bedclothes again, nodded.</p>

<p>“‘And some of the boys were beginning to call you “Roly-poly
George,” weren’t they? And they were telling you that soon you’d
be able to join the circus as the fat boy? It wasn’t very kind of them
perhaps, but it was true, eh?’ And the Goblin grinned.</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ was all George could say.</p>

<p>“‘And last of all, you ate that whole layer of chocolates in the box
that was hidden in the pantry; you thought you were having a great
feast. Until—until—until—’</p>

<p>“‘Oh I know,’ said George. ‘I felt dreadfully sick—but I’m better
now. Don’t scold me any more, please.’</p>

<p>“‘I won’t,’ said the Goblin. ‘I visit little boys and girls like you
because I know you don’t want to get sick—and half the time you don’t
know that so many sweeties are very, very bad for you—and that you’ll
grow fat and lazy and no one will care for you when it comes play
time.’</p>

<p>“‘I’ll be good—and not a piggie any more!’ said George. ‘I did
feel so sick—and I don’t want to be the fat boy in the circus. I want to
stay at home and play with my friends!’</p>

<p>“‘And you will!’ said the Goblin. ‘To-morrow morning you’ll be
all right—but first of all—to-night we’re going to take you for a sail
in our airboat just to show you that Goblins are really nice creatures
after all!’</p>

<p>“And several weeks later, George was so well and so strong and
quick in the games that he was made Captain of his Baseball Team!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day204">JULY 22: Jack-in-the-Pulpit</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“I am Jack-in-the-pulpit,” announced a wild flower one day.</p>

<p>“Are you?” asked the gnats and flies walking and flying about.</p>

<p>“I am indeed,” said Jack. “If you don’t believe me, you can
have a look.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span></p>

<p>“We are invited to have a look,” said the gnats to each other and
the flies said: “We can call upon him, and he looks very fine, too.”</p>

<p>“In the spring,” said Jack, for he thought it was the correct thing
to preach a little sermon as he was in a pulpit, “in the spring,” he continued,
“I have many bright red berries. Years and years ago the
Indians used to boil these berries and found them very good to eat.</p>

<p>“But at this time of the year, I am simply at my best. Oh, yes, I
feel so jolly and well, so happy and gay.”</p>

<p>And Jack smiled at the little creatures around him.</p>

<p>“You would be surprised, no doubt,” he went on, “if I should tell
you a few things about my family history. Some I will leave unsaid,
however,” he added with a roguish look.</p>

<p>Now, over Jack’s head was a part of the flower which looked like the
sounding-board of a pulpit. He stood very straight in his pulpit,
which was very handsome, striped in greenish-yellow, white and orange-yellow
colored decorations.</p>

<p>“I have a fine cousin,” he said, “and this is the part of my family
history I want to tell you. My cousin is the Calla-lily and she has a
beautiful white gown which she wears. But she is striped as I am, and
she is a cousin, though she cares more for dress than I do, and looks
very stately and fine.</p>

<p>“I am more natural,” said Jack. “I’m a good sort of a chap. I
like to talk to my little friends and give them advice because I am very
fond of preaching.”</p>

<p>“He must be very fine,” the gnats said.</p>

<p>“How beautiful to give us advice,” the flies added.</p>

<p>And to himself Jack was saying: “The poor little insects, little do
they know me. I am not as fine as I make myself out to be. I
should just say I’m not.</p>

<p>“For I do not practice what I preach. I don’t believe in doing such
a foolish thing. That is, I preach to the little creatures and then I
let them come and see my pulpit—and then, it’s very, very seldom that
I ever let them out again.” Then Jack began to preach once more
and gathered about him more stupid and innocent little gnats and flies!
But, of course, as he is only a flower we can’t blame him too much.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“Billie Brownie was talking to the High Tide as it came up
over the beach,” said daddy. “‘Don’t you ever work any
faster or any slower?’ asked Billie Brownie.</p>

<p>“‘Certainly not,’ said the Tide. ‘Why should we?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span></p>

<p>“‘It would be nice, I should think, to change some day and rush in
very suddenly, and then some other day stay way out on the beach and
not come in for hours and hours—long after you are due.’</p>

<p>“‘That would be very wrong,’ said the Tide. ‘We are helped in
what we do by two very noble creatures.’ And all the time the Tide
was talking its voice would get louder and louder, for all the waves
were roaring and making such a racket.</p>

<p>“‘Who are they?’ asked Billie Brownie.</p>

<p>“‘The Sun and the Moon,’ roared the Tide. ‘The Moon is three
times more important than the Sun—but the Sun is mighty helpful too.
We do as they say, you see. Twice every twenty-four hours of your
time we come in and go out. And we do this at such hours as the Sun
and Moon wish. So if people ask the Sun and Moon, or watch them
for a time, they will be able to tell just what we are going to do. And
we never change the time they’ve given us—never—NEVER!’ And
the Tide bellowed this for all it was worth.</p>

<p>“‘I wouldn’t keep such good time,’ said Billie Brownie, ‘no, not for
any creature—not even Mr. Sun or Mr. Moon. And yet I’m a great
friend of both.’</p>

<p>“‘Ah, you’re not such a friend as we are,’ said the Tide. ‘We have
always done as Mr. Moon said for years and years and years—too
many for me to remember.’</p>

<p>“‘But you might just as well be a clock and get wound up if you’re
going to keep such good time and do things just exactly when you’re
supposed to. It seems very foolish to me,’ and Billie Brownie put his
head to one side as he thought about it.</p>

<p>“‘Ah,’ said the Tide, ‘that’s just where you’re so wrong. A clock
has to be looked after. Some one has to wind it up. No one has to
wind us up. And a clock often gets out of order and goes to the clock-maker
to be mended. You never heard of the Tide going to a Tide
Mender to be mended, did you?’</p>

<p>“‘I never knew there was such a thing as a Tide Mender,’ said Billie
Brownie.</p>

<p>“‘There isn’t!’ said the Tide. ‘That’s just it. We don’t need
one—for we never get out of order. And no one has to worry about
us or fuss about us. We just do as Mr. Sun and Mr. Moon say—especially
Mr. Moon, as I’ve told you, for somehow,’ and the voice of
the Tide grew lower, ‘Mr. Moon has better judgment. I can whisper
this to you now, for Mr. Sun has gone to bed and won’t feel hurt!
And now I must go out to the ocean again—for I’ve been talking to
you for hours.’”</p>

ear:</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ answered Edith looking about her. And then, seeing no
one, said:</p>

<p>“‘Who are you? Where are you?’</p>

<p>“‘I’m the Fairy Queen,’ said the voice, ‘and you can’t see me because
I’ve put on my invisible robe—which no one can see but a Fairy.
I’ve come to talk to you. I know how you love your garden and
that you’ve not been able to make anything grow this summer. Listen!’
And a queer swishing sound passed through the air.</p>

<p>“‘There!’ continued the Fairy Queen, ‘I have waved my invisible
wand and it will bring you luck. Do not plant any seeds for a week—then
the snails will think you have decided not to have any garden
at all! It will be a joke on them—but they have had enough feasts
and now it is time for you to have a garden!’</p>

<p>“In a short time Edith had real flowers, and her garden was more
beautiful than ever it had been, and often when she was working among
the flowers, she said half aloud:</p>

thank her, oh, so much, for my lovely garden.’”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day207">JULY 25: The Earth Visits the Moon</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“When Mr. Moon is ‘eclipsed,’ as they say, it means the
earth gets in the way, and when Mr. Sun is ‘eclipsed’ it
means that Mr. Moon is in the way. And that makes
it dark—for an Eclipse is a shadow,” explained daddy.</p>

<p>“Mr. Moon was shining hard. He was very bright and the sky
seemed to be lighted up by him. All the stars were out and were
twinkling with joy and fun, for well they knew what was going to
happen.</p>

<p>“Mr. Moon was also looking very fat and well! Goodness! but he
was round and big and jolly! He blinked one eye and then he winked
with the other, and he said to himself:</p>

<p>“‘The Earth is going to pay me a visit to-night. I am highly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
honored. It’s not often that the earth comes my way—and that’s why
I am all dressed up in my best.’</p>

<p>“Pretty soon the grown-ups on the Earth saw a shadow come over
part of Mr. Moon’s face. Very, very slowly he grew darker, and the
Earth people all came out of doors to watch what was going to
happen.</p>

<p>“‘I’m pretty important, I am,’ said Mr. Moon to two very tall pine
trees. And the pine trees whispered back in the slight, rustling breeze:</p>

<p>“‘Yes, Mr. Moon, you’re very important. And you show us off
too. We look handsome, and dark, and tall, when you throw your
light over us.’</p>

<p>“‘Hush—’ said Mr. Moon. ‘The Earth is on its way.’</p>

<p>“And only half of Mr. Moon could be seen now. The other half
was covered up by a dark shadow.</p>

<p>“‘That’s the earth throwing its shadow on the moon,’ said the grownups
to each other. But up in the sky the Moon was saying:</p>

<p>“‘Well, how do you do, Mr. Earth? It’s a long time since I’ve
seen you. And how have you been all this time?’</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ said the Earth, as it cast its shadow over Mr. Moon still
more, ‘I’ve been in my usual good health. I still am a pretty good
and solid soul, you know. I stand for so much too! I let folks walk
all over me, and still I never murmur in the least. I let the King of
the Clouds pour down on me—and Mr. Sun warms me up with his
rays so that I begin to grow thirsty again.</p>

<p>“‘And,’ the Earth continued, ‘sometimes the children dig me up—and
I don’t mind in the very least. It’s just my nature, I suppose!’</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ said Mr. Moon, ‘you are a good-natured old soul.’</p>

<p>“‘Old?’ asked the Earth. ‘Why, every spring I am just as young
and fresh again as if I were not a minute old. Whatever do you mean,
Mr. Moon?’</p>

<p>“‘That’s true,’ said Mr. Moon. ‘You certainly do come up younger
every spring—but you have been around a great many years.’</p>

<p>“‘It’s a good thing I have,’ laughed the Earth; ‘and now tell me
how you have been?’</p>

<p>“Mr. Moon was almost entirely covered by the Earth’s shadow as
he began his talk:</p>

<p>“‘I am shining as brightly as ever, and I still change my suit several
times a month. In fact, there’s not much difference in me—or in my
life. I do much the same things always. I’m what you might call a
very sensible old fellow. I do everything right on time, and enjoy
myself hugely.’</p>

<p>“‘There, there,’ said the Earth. ‘I must be going again.’</p>

<p>“‘What short visits you pay,’ said Mr. Moon as he began to show
his brightness again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span></p>

<p>“‘Do you know why I do that?’ whispered the Earth.</p>

<p>“‘No,’ said Mr. Moon, and he took a little walk along the sky.</p>

<p>“‘Because,’ said the Earth, ‘grown-ups think it’s a wonderful thing
when I call on you. I don’t let them get used to it—and so they
think that it’s very, very m-a-r-v-e-l-o-u-s! Look at all the Earth
people, and then you’ll agree with me.’</p>

wouldn’t feel any pain at all. It made it feel quite dull and
the throbbing which he had felt for two weeks went away.</p>

<p>“In a very few minutes, with the help of an instrument which made
the elephant shake a little nervously as he saw it (for he couldn’t
imagine what it might be), out came the tooth.</p>

<p>“‘There,’ said the Zoo dentist, ‘you will have no more pain.’</p>

<p>“In a few days the elephant was himself again. The soreness had
all gone away and he was eating once more—and eating the most delicious
of dishes, for the keeper said:</p>

<p>“‘I want to reward you all I can, as you’re the bravest creature I’ve
ever known, for you’ve had this toothache for some time and we never
knew it until your mouth became so swollen. Yet you never complained.

<p>“There was more room everywhere and people almost all had gardens
and flowers and could walk just a little distance and gather all the
wild flowers they wanted.</p>

<p>“But the cities grew up and somehow, without meaning to, I’m
sure, they pushed the flowers out of the way.</p>

<p>“Many of the people missed the flowers and the ferns and the shrubs
and the Nature children. But they couldn’t do the work they had to in
the city and have gardens, too, for there wasn’t any room in the city for
the gardens.</p>

<p>“Well, when the spring-time came along one year, after so many
cities had grown bigger and bigger and so many people had gone to
live in the cities, the Nature children called and said:</p>

<p>“‘Mother Nature, the Dream King has told us that many, many
people from the cities will be out in the country places for holidays

us that every once in a while the people get very tired from all the business
they must do and all the studying they must do, too.</p>

<p>“‘So we’ve decided we would look our very best all the time, so that
when the people from the cities come out to see us they may pick some
of us and take us home with them so we’ll cheer them up.’</p>

<p>“I told them I thought their idea was wonderful. And ever since
then the flowers have all looked their best and the shrubs have all looked
their best and the ferns have all looked their best, so they could cheer
up the city people when they were taken back after holidays.</p>

<p>“So when any of you are picked and carried to the cities, keep your
prettiest and freshest smiles on your faces.”</p>

day, ‘for I will have to have some make-believe games now that I have
to be in bed a little while longer.’</p>

to-day? Of course you can’t talk to me. But I can talk to you, and
I will do you the great honor due one of your rank and station—that

Highness this fine evening? I don’t suppose Your Ladyship cares to
have a little chat, but I am sure Your Ladyship wouldn’t mind being

<p>“They all went as different flowers. One little fairy
was dressed so she looked like a bright red nasturtium, another was
dressed as a pink rambler rose, another as a yellow golden-glow, another
as a pansy, another as a little forget-me-not, and all of them, in
short, in lovely costumes like flowers.</p>

<p>“The Fairy Queen wore the costume of the American Beauty Rose,
and her wand was one tall, tall rose, very full and big and splendid.</p>

<p>“They had dancing and games and all the elves, the brownies and
many of the wood creatures had been invited. But one of the funniest
things happened you can imagine. Some of the fairies had dressed
themselves as honey-suckles. They kept together and danced together
so they would look like a vine. Others had dressed as a vine of morning-glories.</p>

<p>“Pretty soon a buzzing was heard. It was louder than the band of
crickets they had engaged for the music; it was louder than the sounds
that came from the laughter of the fairies.</p>

<p>“You see, nobody had thought of such a thing happening. The bumble-bees
and the humming birds, who had all gone to sleep, had in
their dreams imagined they saw lovely morning glories still awake and
lovely honey-suckles all over the vines.</p>

<p>“One little bumble-bee went to his smaller brother and nudged him,
saying,</p>

<p>“‘Oh, look over there; morning-glories!’</p>

<p>“The other little bumble-bee was about to turn over and go to sleep,
for he had scarcely so much as peeped to see, when he, too, suddenly
noticed all the morning-glories. They awoke all the bumble-bees far
and near and made so much fuss and noise that they woke up the
humming-birds, who always notice what the bumble-bees are up to.</p>

<p>“Of course the humming-birds immediately spied the honey-suckles,
and you should have seen them scamper.</p>

<p>“When the fairies realized what had happened they almost lost their
balance in the dances, for they shook all over with laughter.</p>

<p>“As the bumble-bees and the humming-birds got nearer they, too, saw

they are not sure whether or not we are ripe, and so they will be delighted

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day214">AUGUST 1: The Brave Mocking Bird</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“I have a true story to tell you this evening, children,” said daddy,
“of a mocking bird.</p>

<p>“Mr. Mitchell Mocking Bird was his name and he was a pet
in a large family of children. They all loved him and he could speak
a good many words, and he could sing like ever so many birds. He
was allowed out of his cage, too. One night Mitchell began to scream.
How he did yell! Piercing yells went all through the house! And he
hurried from one bedroom to another. He awoke the mother and
daddy of the children first and then he woke up the children.</p>

<p>“‘Come!’ he called. It was a word he could say, and he kept repeating
it over and over again.</p>

<p>“‘Come! Come! Come!’ And they all hurried, one after the
other, and followed the mocking bird downstairs.</p>

<p>“What should they see but a tiny blaze, which every few minutes
seemed to grow and splutter and burst into a bigger flame.</p>

<p>“‘Water! Every one get water!’ shouted the children’s daddy, and
the mocking bird kept calling:</p>

<p>“‘Come!’</p>

<p>“They were all thoroughly frightened but they kept their wits about
them and kept filling buckets and jugs with water which they poured over
the flame.</p>

<p>“After a little while it was out. The Mocking Bird looked very tired.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
His eyes blinked as if he could hardly keep awake, and it was just
then that every one of them noticed him.</p>

<p>“‘Mitchell, you have saved the house and our lives. That fire would
have spread and goodness knows what would have happened,’ said
their daddy. ‘What a fine, brave bird you are.’</p>

<p>“And the children stroked Mitchell and said:</p>

<p>“‘Fine, brave bird. Daddy says so, too! Our lovely Mitchell Mocking
Bird.’</p>

<p>“Mitchell was almost asleep. The fire was out. He had finished
his work. He was ready to rest now. He didn’t care about praise.
But he was happy that they all loved him so. And how he cared for
them. He had saved them and they knew it. He was very happy.
And in his own bird way he had thought all this out.</p>

<p>“But to the great surprise of them all, Mitchell said a word they
had never known he could say, but it was just the right one. ‘Safe, all
safe,’ said Mitchell, as he went to sleep.”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Now the milkweed plant is rather thick with a hollow center
and through this center the white milk goes which gives the
plant its food. The milk doesn’t care for the air and so that
is why the milk stains our hands when we pick the plants.</p>

<p>The leaves are large and of a yellow, gray-green color, while the
flowers which grow in clusters are of a pink-lavender shade.</p>

<p>But the little pods filled with seeds are the things the children like
and if you see a milkweed plant just look at the little pods.</p>

<p>“I must have milk to drink and to make me strong,” said Milly
Milkweed.</p>

<p>“So must I,” said Mamie Milkweed.</p>

<p>“And not only does it make us strong,” said Milly, “but it gives
strength to the butterflies which feast upon us, for if we are strong
and delicious it makes them strong and beautiful.</p>

<p>“Ah,” said Mamie, “it’s fine to have butterflies and children for
friends, and to have our very own milkman always with us. We’re never

“Lady Lettuce and the Lettuce youngsters are coming up,
too, and there are going to be lots of crops of us. We
make a fine salad, we’re so young and tender and fresh. Seems to me,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
Telephone Peas, you hurried me up. You know this is our second crop.
We’ve been here before. But I do believe it was your very name
that hurried me.</p>

<p>“I heard you say it and I acted as my relatives say people do when
they hear the telephone. I’ve even heard that they’ve left the salad
on their plates and have answered the telephone before they ate their
salad. Yes, your very name and saying it must have hurried us.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the Telephone Peas, “we feel up to date. We don’t
know that there is any special reason for our name, but we have grown
to like it mighty well. We’re supposed to be a large, good kind, too;
in fact, one of the best there are.”</p>

<p>“Dear me,” said one of the String-Beans, “I wish some one would
call our family the Airplane String-Beans or something like that. Or
perhaps we might be called the Submarine String-Beans.”</p>

<p>“There wouldn’t be much sense to that,” said the Potato, almost
ready to eat, “for you are up on vines. Now we might have that
name because we’re in the ground, though it is true we are not under
the water.”</p>

<p>And the garden vegetables all agreed that that was true but that the
Telephone Peas had a fine family name in reality.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day217">AUGUST 4: The Harebell Umbrellas</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“The musk-ox,” said daddy, “is prepared for the rain by the
coarse hair which grows on top of his nice, soft hair. This
coarse hair, as you know, catches the rain and then he shakes
it all off so that his body doesn’t get wet.</p>

<p>“The umbrella bird can put up some of his feathers just as people
put up their umbrellas and that protects him from the rain.</p>

<p>“Both the great big musk-ox and the little umbrella bird are very
proud that they always have their rain protectors with them, and they
have very little use for people who forget their umbrellas and borrow
other people’s and then forget to return them.</p>

<p>“Of course the musk-ox and the umbrella bird can’t very well lend
their umbrellas because they don’t carry them around by the beak or
front paw, but instead have their umbrellas attached to them.</p>

<p>“But they aren’t the only creatures to be so careful about the rain,
that is, there are some flowers who are just as careful, and the harebell,
of which I am going to tell you, sees that none of its family will
ever drown.</p>

<p>“Now, the harebell family of flowers are blue in color. The flowers
grow on thin, rather tall stems, and when the flowers are in bud they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
grow very straight and stand right up. When the tiny buds burst
into flowers, if they stayed straight up, as they stand when they are
buds, every time the rain came it would fill the little flowers and completely
drown them, and make them droop forever.</p>

<p>“The little blue petals aren’t strong enough to stand the rain, and
the flowers are shaped so the rain would come right into them and fill
them up—for the harebells are like little bells. So they drop their
little heads just before they open and then the rain can’t hurt them.”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“This way to the big show,” some children were shouting.
“Come right along,” they said. “This is the way to see all
the wonders of the age. Look at the Frog-Child, the Snake-Lady,
the Toad-Man, the Turtle Babies.”</p>

<p>All the children went in the direction from which the shouts and
orders were given.</p>

<p>The children who were shouting were very much excited. “Admission
to the show, ten cents,” they kept saying. “It’s the most wonderful
show in the world.”</p>

<p>There were a dozen children giving a play-circus which was supposed
to be very much like a real one. They had asked all their friends and
the money they received was to go to a children’s ward in a hospital.
Every one of their friends came and soon the circus began. First of
all there was a long parade while some of the children beat drums and
others played tunes on combs covered with tissue paper.</p>

<p>Two little girls rode ponies and on the heads of the ponies sat two
monkeys made of cloth! They had bead eyes!</p>

<p>A boy did a lot of fine tricks on a rocking horse, and there were all
the usual circus tricks, although perhaps not some of the more difficult
ones.</p>

<p>After a little while a boy came out on the platform and said,</p>

<p>“Ladies and Gentlemen, Boys and Girls, Cats and Dogs, we have now
to offer a fine performance—a side show. We have shown you the
regular acts of the circus and we trust that you are pleased.” Here
followed a great deal of clapping and shouting.</p>

<p>“And,” the boy continued, “we are now to have the great privilege of
seeing the Frog-Child, the Snake-Lady, the Toad-Man, the Turtle-Babies.
Step this way, Ladies, Gentlemen, Boys, Girls, Cats and Dogs.
Come right inside the tent at your left and there you will see these
things. There is no extra charge for admission.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span></p>

<p>All the children at once began to troop to their left through the
side tent.</p>

<p>“What could it mean?” they asked each other. What surprises they
were getting!</p>

<p>When they were inside the tent how they did laugh! One of the
children was in just such a green suit as Mr. Frog would wear and really
looked quite a good deal like a grandson of Grandpa Frog. He was
hopping about singing in a queer croaking voice,</p>

<p>“Galloo, Galloo, Goog-a-room, Goog-a-room.”</p>

<p>Another child who looked like a snake, because she wore an imitation
snakeskin, said, “Come and see the Snake-Lady. I eat things whole.”
And as she said this she swallowed a tiny crumb.</p>

<p>“I am the Toad-Man, come and see me,” grunted the Toad—or
rather the child who was dressed like one.</p>

<p>“We are the Turtle Babies. We snap, we play, we draw in our heads
under our shells!” And sure enough they were doing all these tricks.</p>

<p>Their costumes were really quite wonderful, although they had been
made mostly out of paper.</p>

<p>All the children who were looking on were quite delighted and said,</p>

<p>“We think you are marvelous!” And all the children dressed like
animals made bows and said thank you in voices that sounded a great
deal like the voices of snakes, toads, frogs and turtles.</p>

<p class="dropcap">“Won’t you tell me what your name means?” asked Effie
Elf of Mr. Bank Swallow. “Really, you have such a
curious name and I’ve always been anxious to find out what
it means.”</p>

<p>“My name is Bank Swallow because I and my family build our nests
in holes in banks. By banks I mean the banks out of doors and not the
banks where one saves one’s money.</p>

<p>“We are very friendly with one another, and we have big towns and
villages and cities of nests of Bank Swallows.</p>

<p>“We’re the very smallest of the Swallow family, I believe. And we
can always be known by our neck bands which we wear on our gray
throats. Our neck bands are much darker and show very clearly.</p>

<p>“We dress in simple brown and gray, though our throats are white.</p>

<p>“We have tunnels and long entrances to our homes, and at the end
of our tunnels we build the nest. Yes, we’re rather unusual, I believe.”</p>

<p>“Very unusual,” said Effie Elf. “Fancy nesting in a hole in a bank
rather than in a tree. That is quite odd, quite different from most of
the birds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span></p>

<p>“So your name has nothing to do with banks where they have
money?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Nothing at all,” said the Bank Swallow. “We haven’t any need of
money. Of course if we needed it we’d probably save some for the
bad days and spend the rest on good insects to eat and other delicacies.
But we don’t have to pay for what we eat, so we don’t need any money.</p>

<p>“Besides, we’d be ashamed to open bank accounts for the banks are
used to so much money that they’d laugh at us.”</p>

<p>“Oh, nonsense!” said Effie Elf, “the good ones wouldn’t do that, for
no one who amounts to anything makes fun of any one else not having
so much.</p>

<p>“People who don’t amount to much put on airs.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day220">AUGUST 7: The Cuckoo-Clock</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Julius was very sleepy and he could hardly keep his eyes open.
The whole trouble was that he hated to do things on time. He
did not like to go to bed at the hour he was supposed to and he
never, never wanted to get up in the morning when his mother said,
“Time to get up, Julius.”</p>

<p>And now he was sleepy, now in the middle of the afternoon. It was
raining hard outside and in the big library where he was sitting a large
open fire was burning merrily. Near the fireplace was a cuckoo-clock
and Julius always loved to watch the little cuckoo come out and tell
any one who happened to be listening just what time it was.</p>

<p>“It’s almost time for the cuckoo to come out,” said Julius. “But
oh gracious, how sleepy I am. I know I was late in going to bed last
night but I don’t see why I should be so dreadfully sleepy. I do hope I
will stay awake until the cuckoo says five o’clock. It is so much nicer
to hear him on the hour than at other times, because he only says ‘cuckoo’
once when the hand is at the half hour.”</p>

<p>“Cuckoo,” said the cuckoo bird in the clock. And then he said it
four times more. Each time he made a little bow as he spoke and when
he had said “cuckoo” for the fifth time, Julius was waiting to watch the
little door close.</p>

<p>The cuckoo in the clock always lives behind a little door over the face
of the clock, and when he is not telling the time he is in there.</p>

<p>But this time the door did not close. And the cuckoo stayed out of
his little home bobbing and saying “cuckoo” many times over, until
at last it sounded like “Julius, Julius, Julius.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Julius, “you are calling me by my right name. How are
you, Mr. Cuckoo Bird of the clock?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span></p>

<p>The little bird was made of wood, to be sure, but he seemed so certain
of himself and so well satisfied that Julius felt he must be alive.</p>

<p>“I am well, I thank you kindly,” said the cuckoo bird. “But I don’t
have to ask you.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Julius.</p>

<p>“Because I know,” said the cuckoo bird. “You are sleepy, and it’s
not the time to sleep. Ha, ha, ha. Whatever would you do if you
were a clock, or if your home was at the top of one?”</p>

<p>“Well, I am not a clock,” said Julius, “and I am jolly glad of it.”</p>

<p>“Tut, tut,” said the cuckoo bird. “You are getting quite cross,
Master Julius. Too little sleep. Well, well, I suppose I must forgive
you. But it’s a shame you couldn’t live in a clock for a time.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked Julius, who was quite frightened now.
He felt the little cuckoo bird would hop down and pick him right up and
put him in the clock.</p>

<p>“If you could live in a clock and take my place you would have to
be on time. Six o’clock would mean six o’clock and not half-past!
Seven-thirty in the morning would not mean a quarter past eight! Ah
no, in the clock we keep good time. We live on the moment and on the
hour and half-hours we come out to tell people to remember that the
time is going by and they mustn’t waste it for it is so extremely precious.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you believe in people sleeping?” asked Julius.</p>

<p>“To be sure, to be sure,” said the cuckoo, “but I believe they should
sleep at the right time. They should not choose another time for it,
such as the middle of the afternoon, because they sat up too late the
night before.”</p>

<p>Julius was very much ashamed. He felt the cuckoo bird knew that
he had been doing all that and he wished the bird would go back in his
little home and shut the door. He was getting more afraid every
second that he would be taken back there. And oh dear, how he would
hate to live in a clock.</p>

<p>“Just suppose,” said the cuckoo bird, “that I did things at the wrong
time. Suppose I should come out at six o’clock and tell every one it
was eight? You can’t imagine it, can you? And why not? Because
I have had the training of a clock. I have been an assistant in keeping
the time and if I don’t notice that you think more of the time I will
put you back of the clock.” The cuckoo bird banged his little door,
and Julius, awaking with a start, rubbed his sleepy eyes, and said,</p>

<p>“I shall always do things on time from now on for how dreadful it
must be to live back of a clock and have the hours depend so much on
you.”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“Zuzeppa,” said daddy, “was a monkey who had come from
Africa and he was going to give a special performance of his
acting. The special performance was to be given on a day
set aside by the keeper. Of course it couldn’t be advertised all around
as a circus could, but the keeper told all his special children friends
who came to the zoo very often and they told their friends, and it got
around so that for the day of the performance the monkey house was
filled with children.</p>

<p>“‘Let me shake hands with the performer,’ the keeper said, and he
shook hands with Zuzeppa. Then they each bowed, and the keeper
said, ‘Now Zuzeppa will show you his circus tricks.’</p>

<p>“So Zuzeppa hung by his tail and turned many somersaults; he swung
back and forth and jumped and twisted and turned. He did the most
marvelous of circus tricks and all the children clapped their hands and
the other monkeys yelled and screamed, ‘Well done, Zuzeppa.’</p>

<p>“No one else knew what the monkeys meant but every one knew they
were excited. They weren’t jealous of Zuzeppa, for they knew he
wanted to learn tricks and be a trick-performing monkey. Besides he
had worked hard enough to have a whole monkey house to himself for
all afternoon.</p>

<p>“‘Now,’ said the keeper, ‘Zuzeppa will do his special trick. It has
been done before by monkeys but Zuzeppa never did it before, and
he has been practising it so he could do it beautifully for this performance.’</p>

<p>“The keeper took out a little wooden table and put a napkin upon it
and a cloth. Then Zuzeppa spread the cloth over the table, reached
down in a box the keeper had, and took out a knife and a fork and a
spoon. He put all these on the table and then tied the napkin around
his neck.</p>

<p>“Next he took a little broken chair which was in his cage and sat
upon it.</p>

<p>“The keeper acted as the waiter, and passed things to Zuzeppa.
And what do you suppose Zuzeppa did?”</p>

<p>“What?” asked the children.</p>

<p>“Zuzeppa behaved at the table just as though he were a real person.
He ate with his fork and he cut with his knife. He peeled his banana
which he had for dessert and then he ate it, wiping his mouth with his
napkin.</p>

<p>“But when he was all through his meal and had put his hands in a
finger bowl to make them nice and clean, he took a pipe, which the keeper
handed to him, struck a match and lighted the pipe. He only smoked
for a second or two, blowing the smoke out, as he didn’t especially care<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
for it. But oh, how happy he was when the children laughed and
clapped their hands! And this is a true story!”</p>

<p class="dropcap">“I can’t understand,” said Mrs. Chickadee, “how creatures can
live together and quarrel all the time. It is such waste of perfectly
good time in the first place.</p>

<p>“In the second place it isn’t any fun. Now, singing and chirping and
worm hunting and bread-crumb parties are all lots of fun.</p>

<p>“But quarreling isn’t any fun at all. It makes creatures unhappy and
it makes them very often quite sad. Even if they get the best of a
quarrel they don’t feel all happy and excited as they do after a fine party.</p>

<p>“Now, the Sparrows fight all the time. But no one would ever describe
the Sparrow as a merry, happy little bird.</p>

<p>“There is the Starling. No one would describe him as a happy bird.
And the Starling is a fighter, too.</p>

<p>“We scold in fun, nice chuckling, scolding notes we give, but we are
famous for our good spirits. Chick-a-dee-dee-dee.</p>

<p>“I’m sure most people know what we look like with our little black-capped
heads and the patch of black right under our beaks.</p>

looking and rather smart, too.</p>

<p>“In the winter time we like to be about, too. And nothing upsets
us. We never grumble over the weather. We can’t understand how
people can grumble over the weather.</p>

<p>“To us it is so foolish. The weather is going to do just what it wants
to, in the first place, and isn’t going to pay attention to any one, nor is it
going to pay any attention to what any one thinks. And yet how few
seem to realize that!”</p>

<p>“Well, I was sitting on the fence, this very same fence

in the yard near-by.</p>

<p>“While they were playing I made all sorts of queer sounds just like
a cat.</p>

<p>“You know how I can take off the various sounds of a cat?”</p>

<p>“I most certainly do that,” said Billie Brownie.</p>

for the cat.</p>

<p>“I almost fell off the fence laughing when they started to look for
the cat.</p>

<p>“Then when they were looking by the cellar stairs and under the old
tree yonder I took great chances that they might see that I was not
the cat, and I made the same sounds again.</p>

<p>“They kept saying to each other:</p>

<p>“‘Well, I’m sure I heard a cat that time.’</p>

<p>“I really and truly almost fell off the fence laughing. Then they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
came back and went on with their games. They saw me sitting here
and I had my beak tight and looked as though I hadn’t made a sound.”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Billie Brownie.</p>

<p>“Then I sat very still, of course, and one of them said:</p>

<p>“‘Well, all I can see is that gray bird with the black cap.’</p>

<p>“Of course they meant they could see me, and I was the one making all
the sounds like a cat.</p>

<p>“They finished playing after a time and began to dig in the garden,
transplanting the lettuce and hoeing the beans and watering the vegetables.</p>

<p>“Then I began to make sounds like the different birds and they
would turn to one another and say:</p>

<p>“‘What song is that? Whose voice was that? Do you know what
bird that could have been?’</p>

<p>“And they’d look about and not see any of the other birds, for hardly
any birds were around then, and I sat, looking so quiet and meek.</p>

<p>“And then I heard one of them say:</p>

<p>“‘I still don’t see any other creature but that gray bird.’</p>

<p>“I thought surely then that they knew I was fooling them, but I
found out they didn’t know I could make sounds like a cat and sing
like the other birds and sometimes like a mocking-bird, too.</p>

<p>“But they didn’t know. And they’ve all gone off now. And still
they’re wondering where the cat could have been which they thought
they heard, and where all the birds were they were unable to see.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha, ha, that is the greatest joke—to think I fooled them all.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’re a smart bird, there is no mistake about that,” said
Billie Brownie, “and I can tell you I admire your smartness.”</p>

<p>“I fooled them, I fooled them,” chirped Mr. Catbird. “They didn’t
know the catbird when they saw him, nor did they know him when
they heard him at his little jokes!”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">This was the story the Fairy Queen told before her banquet
the other evening.</p>

<p>“An old lady had a little cabin home just off these woods.
Her only companion was a cat. The cat was black but two paws
were white, and the old lady thought they were very wonderful.</p>

<p>“Now and again the old lady had to go into the village to buy food.
Sometimes the cat would follow, wearing a little jingling bell, for the
old lady wanted to be sure that the cat had lots to eat, but that he
would never get a bird.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span></p>

<p>“That was why she had him wear the collar with the little bell.
The bell warned the birds he was coming, so they could get away.
He could be heard coming along by the sound of the tingling bell.</p>

<p>“But this time, when the old lady went into the village the cat was
sleepy and sat on the porch in the sunshine.</p>

<p>“‘Will you come, pussy?’ she asked. But the pussy blinked his eyes
as though to say, ‘I am sleepy.’ So she went off.</p>

<p>“When she came back she found to her horror that the cottage had
been burned down. Some one had left a match lighted in the woods,
and a fire had started which had spread. But even though the house
had burned down the cat sat in front of where the house should be
trying to say, ‘I am sorry, but at least I am here to welcome you.’ And
the old lady hugged her cat and said:</p>

<p>“‘You are always glad to welcome me, and with you here I do not
feel so badly about the house.’</p>

<p>“But,” said the Fairy Queen, “I used my magic wand, and in three
minutes and four seconds and two quarter-seconds the house was up
again—and the old lady had both her home and her cat.”</p>

<p>“That was a real fairy tale,” the fairies and their friends all said.</p>

<p>“It was indeed,” said the Fairy Queen. “It was about make-believe
characters for a make-believe story, but that makes it a real Fairy Tale,
eh?” And then they all enjoyed the Fairy Queen’s fine banquet.</p>

and thousands of children and many, many grown-ups. ‘You
know,’ said one of the clowns, ‘that I think it would be a good
idea some morning when we haven’t any performance and no parade
and no practice performance, if a good many of us went to one of the
hospital yards and performed for the children who can’t get out and
see us.’ And they did! Every little child was either in a balcony bed
or in a wheeled chair when through the big doors of the large hospital
yard there came a parade—a real circus parade.</p>

<p>“And then the circus band struck up a fine tune and the clowns
marched about and made jokes and giggled—oh, how they did laugh!
And the children all laughed too and clapped their hands. The lady
walked the tight-rope with a parasol over her head, ponies ran around
the yard, and there were some trapezes for those who swung and hung
by their knees and their feet.</p>

<p>“The elephants did their act too—and the children fed them peanuts!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day229">AUGUST 16: The Fire</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“Quack, quack, quack, help, help, help,” shrieked and cackled
more than one hundred thousand ducks at the same time.</p>

<p>“Quack, quack, help, help, help,” they kept on cackling.</p>

<p>“There must be some trouble over at the duck farm,” said a man
who was a fireman and who was sitting outside the firehouse in a town
some distance away when he heard this quacking. He told another
fireman that there surely must be some trouble at the duck farm.</p>

<p>“I think,” said the fireman, “I will get out my spy-glass and see what
I can make out.”</p>

<p>For the quacking kept up and still it sounded very queer to the firemen.</p>

<p>“Don’t you suppose,” said the second fireman, “that one of the ducks
has been hurt and the others are quacking in sympathy?”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe,” said the first fireman, “that one hundred thousand
ducks would be so sympathetic at the same time. And they wouldn’t
make so much noise. I fear something has happened over there.”</p>

<p>And he looked through his spy-glass in the direction of the duck farm.</p>

<p>“There. I see something like smoke,” he said. “Yes, I’m sure I
see something like smoke.”</p>

<p>“Near the duck farm?” said the other fireman, getting up, and
adding: “We’d better send out the alarm and get started.”</p>

<p>“It’s away from the farm that I see the smoke,” said the first fireman,
“but maybe the ducks are afraid it will reach them. It’s one of
those forest fires I think.”</p>

<p>So an alarm was sent out in the town and the firemen rushed to the
firehouse and got on their fire-clothes as they hurried away on the fire-engine.</p>

<p>How the horses did run! Still the ducks were quacking. The
horses galloped, the men held on, and the ones who guided the fire
horses drove as they had never driven before.</p>

<p>“It’s a fire!” shouted the people on the farm. “A terrible forest
fire! Oh, send for the firemen and the engines! Oh, send for help,
help, help.” And they telephoned wildly to the town.</p>

<p>But just at that moment, when the people on the farm felt that help
could not come in time to save them and the hundred thousand ducks,
along dashed the fire-engines and the brave firemen drawn by the
splendid horses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span></p>

<p>They rushed past the duck farm to the forest fire which was coming
steadily nearer.</p>

<p>“Come men, come people,” they shouted as they went by. And every
one went rushing to help the firemen.</p>

<p>The dreadful forest fire was stopped just before it reached the duck
farm, and the ducks cackled softly and happily, though still they were
nervous from all they had been through: “We are safe, quack, quack,
we are safe.”</p>

<p>“How did you ever get here before we telephoned?” asked the
people on the farm.</p>

<p>“Your ducks sent us the alarm,” replied one of the firemen.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day230">AUGUST 17: Friends of Animals</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“Years and years and years ago,” said daddy, “there lived
an emperor in India whose name was Asoka. He was the
first man—in fact, the first person, I believe—to start a hospital
for the cure of sick animals.</p>

<p>“He lived so many years ago that the way we know of much that
was done in his time is by reading what the men who wrote histories
have to tell us. Most of the good deeds which he did were written
upon the rocks, ’way, ’way back, years and years and years ago. And
upon these rocks were also written rules and directions for his people.</p>

<p>“Among many things which he did, in addition to building hospitals
for animals, was to build hospitals for human beings and to see that
they were looked after. He also had wells dug so people could drink
when they were traveling through the country.</p>

<p>“He ordered the planting of trees so people could rest under their
shade, and he spent all his time thinking how he could help others.</p>

<p>“But he was not the first person who tried to help others. He was
the first one, though, to think of a hospital for animals and throughout
the time he was emperor he saw that the hospitals for animals
were kept in good condition.</p>

<p>“Animals with thorns in their feet were taken to the hospital. The
horrid thorns would be taken out and soft, cooling liniment or ointment
poured on and the animal would feel all right once more.</p>

<p>“Animals with sore throats, animals with colds, animals with broken
bones and sprained ankles—all animals who needed attention and care
were looked after in the hospitals founded by Asoka.</p>

<p>“If animals had written histories as well as human beings they would
have written a great deal about Asoka and the wonderful things he
did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span></p>

<p>“But even though they could not write, for future people and future
animals, of Asoka’s goodness, and even though they couldn’t thank him
with words, they were grateful, as only animals can be grateful—very
deeply, dumbly grateful.</p>

<p>“But the historians—the men who wrote about those times—speak
of the goodness of Asoka and of how the people loved him.”</p>

Climbing Perch family before they came to the big aquarium.</p>

<p>“Far, far away in Africa they lived in a river, and were a
very happy family. But one day the river seemed to be drying up so
fast that they couldn’t find enough water to live in. They had noticed
it getting worse and worse every day for some time, and they had been
hoping for rain. But this day it was so bad that they knew something
would have to be done.</p>

<p>“‘Well, even if the river dries up, it won’t bother us,’ said Granddaddy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
Climbing Perch, ‘not in the very least.’ And he gave a huge
spatter-spatter with his tail.</p>

<p>“All the other fishes looked very much worried and their fins trembled
with fear.</p>

<p>“‘Why, Granddaddy Climbing Perch,’ said the old Mother Climbing
Perch, ‘do you want all the children to die?’</p>

<p>“‘I should say not,’ replied Granddaddy Climbing Perch angrily.
‘The very idea of your saying such a thing. I am surprised—yes, surprised,
and very much annoyed.’ Granddaddy Climbing Perch’s fins
wiggled with temper.</p>

<p>“‘I’m sorry,’ said old Mother Climbing Perch meekly, ‘but I didn’t
just understand what you said such a thing for, and why you don’t
seem to be worried that the river is drying up. You always used to
love the children and tell them stories.’</p>

<p>“‘I do still love them, and I shall tell them a true story now of an
adventure which will happen to us. Come around me, children!’ And
Granddaddy Climbing Perch flopped his tail very hard.</p>

<p>“All the fishes swam over by Granddaddy Climbing Perch and looked
at him out of their queer, shiny eyes.</p>

<p>“‘Now, children,’ he began, ‘years and years and years ago, our
great, great, greatgrandfathers were caught just like this in a river
which had dried up. They decided that the only thing for them to
do was to try to make up their minds to die, when the Fairy Queen
happened along.</p>

<p>“‘“I will name you the Climbing Perch,” she said, “and you will
be able to go from pond to pond in the dry seasons. See if it is not so!”
She waved her wand and disappeared—and sure enough all the family
climbed out of the river—which was dry—and with their gills, which
are like saws, they scrambled to the next pond, where there was water.
We will do the same.’</p>

<p>“All the Climbing Perch family now knew the meaning of their
family name, and off they started, led by Granddaddy Climbing Perch.
They got to the next pond where there was water—but they hadn’t
been there for more than a week when that pond dried up, too, and
they had to be off again.</p>

<p>“Would you believe it—but they had to change ponds five times before
they could stay and make a real home! And they are the ones
I saw to-day. Of all the fishes in the Aquarium they are the proudest
because they had had such traveled lives—and they are very happy.
Then, too, after all their hard work, they are glad to be in a big tank
which looks as if it would never go dry!”</p>

<p class="dropcap">“A little girl named Harriet,” said daddy, “was sitting on the
front porch of her home one day when a hurdy-gurdy came
along. An old man was wheeling the hurdy-gurdy and on
top of it sat a monkey with a red jacket and red cap. His jacket had
brass buttons on it, and on either side were two little pockets which
jingled with pennies.</p>

<p>“Then the old man played a tune on his hurdy-gurdy and the monkey
danced. He took off his cap and Harriet took out all the pennies in
her purse—she had had seven—and gave them to the monkey.</p>

<p>“Into one pocket he put four pennies and into the other three. Then
he took off his cap for more. But Harriet said: ‘I have no more
pennies.’ The monkey did not seem to understand at first—but when
Harriet shook her head and showed him her empty purse, he leaned
his head on one side and pretended to cry. He took out a handkerchief
from his pocket and he put it to his eyes as if to wipe the tears away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span></p>

<p>“But soon, when the old man played another tune, the monkey began
to dance around and seemed quite as happy as before.</p>

<p>“And the old man played yet again. But by this time the monkey
was tired, so what do you think he did?”</p>

<p>“What?” exclaimed the children.</p>

<p>“He saw that opposite where Harriet was sitting, there was a
rocking-chair—just like Harriet’s. He gave a jump and up he got into
the chair. Then twisting his tail around him, he began to rock and
rock, back and forth, and how he did seem to enjoy it!</p>

<p>“As they were sitting there opposite each other—Harriet and the
monkey—along came Harriet’s mother. She was surprised to see
Harriet’s guest, and the monkey got right out of the chair and made
a low bow. He began to do his tricks again, and he took the pennies
Harriet’s mother gave him. He also wept when she didn’t give him
any more!</p>

<p>“‘How’d you like to own a fine monkey like that?’ asked the old man.</p>

<p>“‘Oh mother, could I?’ asked Harriet.</p>

<p>“‘Well, he is a cunning little fellow,’ agreed her mother, ‘but what
will daddy say?’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, daddy will think he is great fun,’ said Harriet quickly, for
she saw that her mother was really thinking of letting her keep the

<p>“‘Is he a nice, quiet monkey?’ asked her mother.</p>

<p>“‘Show how quiet you are,’ said the old man. And the monkey
laid down as if he were sound asleep.</p>

<p>“‘I think we’ll keep him,’ said Harriet’s mother, and Harriet
bounded up and down with joy. The monkey copied her and jumped
up and down too, for he had taken a great liking to Harriet—and he
made a polite bow to his former master, as he handed him some money
from Harriet’s mother.”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“Let me tell you,” said Grandfather Corn, “the ways of summer
corn.”</p>

<p>All the ears of corn listened, which, of course, they could
do quite perfectly, as they were all ears!</p>

<p>“I have grown very quickly. I am very big and full grown,” continued
Grandfather Corn. “I wanted to be like this, for in every corn-field
some one must give this word of advice to little ears of corn.”</p>

<p>“Advice, advice,” said the ears of corn. “We are going to hear advice.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span></p>

<p>“That’s it, my bright little ears. I would say my bright little eyes
if I could, but of course I can’t.”</p>

<p>“Too bad,” said the little ears. “But never mind, we are not without
ears, even if we haven’t eyes and noses and chins.”</p>

<p>“Eyes, and noses and chins are very silly and quite useless,” said
Grandfather Corn.</p>

<p>“Certainly for us at any rate,” said the little ears.</p>

<p>“But for the advice,” said Grandfather Corn.</p>

<p>“When it gets cold don’t let any one encourage you into growing.
We will give the people our fine selves as long as the warm weather
remains, but not when it is cold. We’re famous for being summer corn,
and we will never let it be said of us that we were so coarse and hardened
that we could stand the chilly days.” And the little ears nestled
in their silken beds and said they would certainly not try to grow in
the cold weather for they knew they would hate anything that wasn’t
like summer warmth.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day236">AUGUST 23: A Bee Story</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“The worker bees,” said daddy, “carry little pollen baskets
and they bring in the pollen to the young. They also bring
in some sweetened water which the little ones like very much
indeed.</p>

<p>“Now and again on a very hot day a number of bees will stand at
the front door of their hive and will fan in some of the outside air so
as to cool the ones who must be within the hive. They always see
that the hive is kept very, very clean. Oh, how neat they are.</p>

<p>“They have to guard against their enemy, the wax moth, too. The
wax moth is a tiny gray moth miller who likes to get into the hive and
feed upon the combs and the pollen stored away in the honey-bees’ cells.
If they are allowed there they will build tunnels through the combs and
destroy them. The Italian bees, little gentle creatures, are fine about
defending themselves, even doing better work than the usual honey-bees.</p>

<p>“The bees must go to many flowers in order to get all the honey that
they need. They love clover, oh, how they love clover, which shows
that they’re not in the least bit snobbish, for clover grows wild in the
fields, of course.</p>

<p>“The bees love buckwheat fields, and from many, many flowers and
a great deal of gathered nectar and pollen, they get the amount of
honey they feel they need for themselves for the time being, and to
store for the future.</p>

<p>“They always work, they hardly ever play. Always they are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
thinking of the day which may come when they won’t have such an easy
time gathering honey, and though they may seem to have all they need
they think it is well to be thrifty and to be ready for a rainy day.</p>

<p>“How the bees love the sweet things of life, the flowers, the honey,
the warmth, the summertime.</p>

<p>“But though they love the sweet things of life, they are never through
working. Right through their little lives they work. They work too
hard. They don’t stop to enjoy their hard work as creatures should.</p>

<p>“Even when they have all the nourishment they need they go on
searching for more for the storehouse. They do not flit about and
enjoy life like the beautiful butterflies. No, they must always work.
They’ve had no help from other creatures; they’ve never destroyed lives
of other creatures in order to get food. Though they flit among all
flowers they never become snobbish and love only the flowers which
cost a lot to grow. They love clover, free clover, best of all.”</p>

<p class="dropcap">“A little girl named Melly,” said daddy, “was having her
portrait painted. The lady who was painting her portrait
one day said to her:</p>

<p>“‘Now, you are such a good girl, and you keep so still while I am
painting a lovely picture of you to give to your mother, that I wonder
if there is anything you would like me to paint for you?’</p>

<p>“‘Oh yes,’ she cried, ‘I’d like to have my dollie painted.’ And when
Melly brought her doll the next time the lady said to herself, ‘I think
I will change the picture of Melly and have her holding her doll, as
she is now.’</p>

<p>“And how differently Melly looked! No longer was she the little
girl sitting stiffly on a chair, looking now and again at the window
and longing to be out with her friends. She was not being good because
she thought she should, but because she was happy having Allie Baa
with her.</p>

<p>“She looked like a real little girl, and the lady was delighted. For
before she had seemed unlike a child. She had looked so sad.</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ said the lady to herself, ‘I will certainly have Melly holding
the doll.’</p>

<p>“And then she did a painting of Allie Baa, and it looked just like
her. How delighted Melly was! She showed the picture of Allie to
her—but of course Allie never even smiled. She looked at it just as
she looked at everything else.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span></p>

<p>“‘You dear, precious dollie,’ said Melly, ‘you don’t care whether you
have a painting of your dear old face or not. But it’s a great comfort
to your mother.’</p>

<p>“The lady was so pleased at the picture of Melly, and she was proud
of herself that she had thought of having Melly bring her doll.</p>

<p>“When Melly’s mother saw the painting she said: ‘Whatever made
you think of having her hold Allie Baa? Why, that is just like my
dear little girl—just the way we always see her. How glad I am.’
And the lady was happy, for she had made the real mother and the
make-believe so pleased!”</p>

sea gull and another was by him. The window ledge was very wide but
they did not seem to be there from choice. Then Teeny remembered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
what a storm there had been the night before, and she thought that
these sea gulls must have been hurt.</p>

<p>Teeny opened the window and took the sea gulls inside. They were
very young and they had been hurt. They had not been hurt very
badly, but they had been very much frightened.</p>

<p>All day Teeny looked after the sea gulls. They grew quite tame,
and as if they knew that Teeny was a little girl of the sea.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon when Teeny remembered that she had
planned to have a Magic Lantern show.</p>

<p>“This will be fine,” said Teeny to herself. “I have two of my audience.
Usually I have to be audience and stage manager, too. Sometimes
daddy and mother come, but they are busy at this time, and usually
I am alone. Of course, I have lots of companions in the pictures
that I show, and I leave them on the sheet which shows the
pictures for a long time and talk to them.”</p>

<p>Teeny took a great cushion and she put the sea gulls upon it. “To-morrow
you will be strong enough to be set free,” she told them. “I
know you hate to be prisoners when you are used to flying over the
great sea.”</p>

<p>The sea gulls paid no attention to the magic lantern show, which disappointed
Teeny a little. But still, they did make an audience, and

<p>“What is it to live in clover?” asked the baby ear. “They say, out in
the corn field, that some folks think it’s fine to live in clover.”</p>

<p>“To live in clover,” said the mother ear, “means just the same as to
live in a silken bed. In fact it means anything that is nice. People
may live in clover and not be near a clover field, because they
may live so happily and in such comfortable, cheery, pleasant homes
that it’s a perfect kind of life. Clover does not always need to mean

had some lemonade and sponge cake, and, oh, it did seem so good

just didn’t know about it—that’s all. Won’t you tell us, Mr. Sun?’</p>

I really didn’t know what to do. I had gone off for
a trip and hadn’t realized how far I had gone. And you
know I’m very young.</p>

<p>“Of course, I would have found my way home in the long run, I
know that. But it was everything to be helped as I was!</p>

<p>“I found myself in another small town where there was a very fashionable
Inn. An Inn is a fashionable boarding-house, I believe, and is
like a smart hotel, only smaller. Now, in this Inn, they didn’t allow
dogs.</p>

<p>“There were many elderly ladies there, and many of them were fussy.</p>

didn’t look the friendly sort.</p>

I am not afraid of him.’</p>

asked to have me fed and a drink of water given to me.</p>

<p>“Then one of the very stylish and superior waiters brought me out
a dainty meal and served me as though I were a fine paying guest, and
called my meal ‘luncheon.’</p>

<p>“Then they telephoned about to the neighbors and others, and asked
questions about any missing dogs that had been reported, and they found
out I belonged to my master, and they helped me to come home.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day245">SEPTEMBER 1: The Whippoorwills</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">In the deep and dark woods, where there are many rocks, and
where people seldom go, live the Whippoorwills.</p>

<p>The Whippoorwills guard their young if danger is near, but
when they are little eggs they are not sheltered by a home-nest—the
ground does well enough for them.</p>

<p>Perhaps Mother Whippoorwill thinks it is a mistake to begin by spoiling
her children, but she is not a hard-hearted mother as this would
seem to show. No, she is always ready to defend them from enemies.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Whippoorwill is about the size of a robin, but he looks
longer because he has great, long wings. He is covered with reddish-brown
feathers, and sometimes grayish-white. He has a fine white
collar and his quills are decorated with white. He has bristles all
about his beak, which is very large.</p>

<p>Mrs. Whippoorwill is just about the same in looks, except she has
a tan collar instead of a white one, and her tail is tan, too.</p>

<p>One night—for the whippoorwills love the night-time—a boy thought
he would like to catch a whippoorwill and have him for a pet. He loved<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
the wonderful song of the whippoorwill—which is a beautiful, rather
sad note. The whippoorwills only sing when away from people, and
they love to be by themselves. That is why they choose their homes
where people will not come.</p>

<p>And he caught Mr. Whippoorwill. “Ah,” he said. “I will be very
good to you. You may have a big place to fly about in, for I have
made it with wire in the yard. And you will have a little home of your
own. I will not keep you in a small cage. That would be cruel.”</p>

<p>The little boy hadn’t thought that it would be cruel to keep the whippoorwill
in any way—the bird who loves solitude—or being alone.</p>

<p>Every night after this he listened to hear his whippoorwill sing, but
never a sound did he make. Then he thought is was because Mr.
Whippoorwill was without his mate, and after a long time he caught
Mrs. Whippoorwill.</p>

<p>Now he would surely have the glorious Whippoorwill singing every
evening, he thought.</p>

<p>But not a sound did he hear. In fact, they seemed to have forgotten
their note—they had left it behind in the woods.</p>

<p>You see, the Whippoorwill will not sing in captivity. He is utterly
miserable then, and he longs to be back where he can be alone and away
from creatures. Then, at night, when it is quiet and dark, we can sometimes
hear his glorious note.</p>

<p>The boy did not know what to make of it, but at last he let them
go. Oh! The joy of spreading their wings toward the dark woods!
How wonderful it was! And to see the Whippoorwill children! To
feel the dark cool woods, to sleep all day, to work all night!</p>

<p>“Ah,” said Mr. Whippoorwill, when he was back in the woods, “I
must see if I can find my note. I left it in the woods behind me.”</p>

<p>“So did I,” said Mrs. Whippoorwill. And to their great delight
they found their notes again—they had just been quiet deep down in
their throats, for they had left the woods, and their little bird hearts had
been too sad for singing. The children joined in too. And the boy
heard them all.</p>

<p>“They sing now,” he said. “They don’t like to be caught.” And
how glad the Whippoorwills were that the boy understood.</p>

houses.</p>

pocket of the red coat he wore. He was all in red and he looked
rather hot and uncomfortable.</p>

<p>“The man would make the monkey do tricks and the people who
watched gave the monkey money. Later on the man took the money.
For what could the monkey do with pennies! He could not go out and
buy food. No, he had to take just what was given to him. And sometimes
he did not get quite enough.</p>

<p>“And yet the old man was always greeted with smiles. No one asked
him if he was good to his monkey. No one said that he ought not to
be making the monkey work on such a hot day.</p>

do any work to speak of all day—so hot had it been—now watched the
monkey work.</p>

the pennies that were given to him in a sort of way, as if he wanted to
say:</p>

them.’</p>

<p>“The hurdy-gurdy played pieces in front of the different places until at
last they stopped before a little gray house.</p>

<p>“‘We won’t stay here long,’ said the man to himself. ‘I don’t believe
we will get many pennies here.’</p>

<p>“Out of a window appeared the head of a little boy. His name was
Bobbie and he loved animals of all sorts.</p>

<p>“He smiled when he saw the cunning little monkey with the red hat
and jacket and the tune of the hurdy-gurdy sounded so bright and jolly
and full of fun.</p>

<p>“He hurried down the stairs and ran out of the front door. What
joy on a horrid, hot day to have a hurdy-gurdy and monkey in the village!
What a treat! What a very great treat! He had three pennies
ready!</p>

<p>“The monkey began to do some tricks, urged on by the man who had
seen the pennies shining from Bobbie’s hand.</p>

<p>“‘Show the little gentleman your fine tricks,’ said the man.</p>

<p>“Bobbie was feeling so happy when suddenly he noticed the face of
the little monkey. Oh, how pleading were his eyes, and Bobbie put his
hand underneath the red jacket. The body of the little monkey was
so hot.</p>

<p>“‘Aren’t you ashamed!’ said Bobbie. ‘The very idea of making a
monkey wear a hot suit on a day like this just because you think it looks
fine!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span></p>

<p>“The man pulled at the monkey’s chain. ‘Come along,’ he said.
‘We’ll not show this gentleman fine tricks.’</p>

<p>“‘I don’t want to see them,’ said Bobbie. ‘On a day when grown
men don’t feel like work, to make a little dumb animal go through
trick after trick to get you money! Aren’t you ashamed!’</p>

<p>“Somehow the man did not go away. He was so surprised at being
talked to in such a way. He really did not know just what to make of
it.</p>

<p>“‘I’ll tell you what I’ll do,’ said Bobbie, who was half sobbing now
with anger. ‘I’ll give you all the pennies from my bank. I have 63
pennies in all. Only, promise me to take off the monkey’s red hat and
jacket and give him a rest to-day and other hot days? To think of a
man making money out of a little monkey when it’s so hot his little
back is burning and his eyes are begging to be allowed rest and a cool
place!’</p>

<p>“‘I’ll promise you,’ said the man, as he took off the monkey’s jacket
and cap. ‘But I won’t take your 63 cents. You and my monkey have
made me ashamed. I’m ashamed enough—I don’t want the 63 cents.’
But Bobbie did give the man and the monkey a nice, cool drink.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day248">SEPTEMBER 4: Larry’s Labor Day</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Larry was five years old and he loved holidays. But the coming
holiday—it was not Larry’s. Nor had it anything to do
with Larry. The thought of that bothered him. He wished
somehow it could be different.</p>

<p>He had asked his father what Labor Day meant and his father had
told him that it was a holiday set apart as a day of recognition of the
laboring class. He had not quite understood what that meant but
his father had explained that it meant a day set aside in honor of there
being such a class as a laboring class, showing that to belong to the
laboring class was something dignified and to be respected.</p>

<p>Larry knew then that it was useless for him to have a share in this
holiday—a real, real share in it at least. This was different from Xmas
and Thanksgiving and the Fourth of July.</p>

<p>But then a happy thought came to him. For the next few days
Larry was very, very busy. Every one thought he was busily playing
and making mud-pies and such, but not at all.</p>

<p>And on the morning of Labor Day they knew what Larry had been
doing. He led his father and his mother and his grown-up sister and
his fourteen-year-old brother to the very far corner of the garden
which had always been set aside as Larry’s mud-pie playground.</p>

<p>There he showed them a tiny garden set out with paths and borders
of pretty pebbles. Growing in the garden were ferns which Larry
had transplanted from the woods and a tiny red geranium stood proudly
in a little bed by itself. It had come from Larry’s nursery flower pot.</p>

<p>“You see,” he said, “I wanted to have a holiday to-day—I mean I
wanted to have a right to the holiday, as daddy talked about laborers
having, so I’ve labor-ed too.” It was rather a hard word to say but
he managed it well.</p>

<p>“And now,” he turned to his family, “don’t you think I can have a
little share in Labor Day too—a real little share?”</p>

<p>And his family said “Yes,” and I think you’ll agree with them too!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day250">SEPTEMBER 6: The Animals’ Talk</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“Of course it is true we do not speak the language people speak.
We have our own way of talking, but that doesn’t mean that
we don’t talk,” said Larry, the monkey.</p>

<p>“It is just as absurd, I think, for people to say that of animals as it
would be for the animals to tell American people that they can’t talk because
they don’t speak like all the other people in the world, or to tell
the French people that they can’t talk because there are people who
speak quite differently from them.</p>

<p>“When we are unhappy we make certain sounds and words of our own.</p>

<p>“When we are frightened we have other sounds to make. When we
are pleased we have still others. When we are playing we have others
again.</p>

<p>“And so have all the animals. The Bears have different kinds of
growls for different things they mean to say.</p>

<p>“The Deer can talk, oh so well!</p>

<p>“The Chimpanzees and the Orang-utans are great talkers and they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
know a lot, too. Don’t people know that? Haven’t they ever seen
and heard a Chimpanzee and his keeper talking?</p>

<p>“Then if they haven’t, I just wish they would! And I wish they’d
come and hear me when I chat with my keeper. He understands me.</p>

<p>“He knows what I want and why I want it, and when I want it. He
knows whether I feel well or sick. He understands me perfectly, and
I understand him.</p>

<p>“Dogs talk, as every one surely must know! And Mr. Siberian
Tiger talks. He told the keeper how pleased he was the other day
when the keeper rubbed his back through the side of the cage.</p>

<p>“He actually purred like a pussy cat!</p>

<p>“And the Wolves! How they talk whether they are here in the
zoo or whether they are free!</p>

<p>“The Bears all talk. And the Rabbits talk. Their thumping sounds
are words, oh yes, indeed.</p>

<p>“Mother Rabbit thumps the ground when danger is near; instead of
saying ‘Danger,’ as people do, Rabbits thump their word ‘Danger.’</p>

<p>“Beavers talk. Prairie Dogs talk, and one of them always guards
when the rest are playing above ground and the one who is guarding certainly
knows how to say ‘Danger’ when danger is near.</p>

<p>“The Striped Chipmunk talks, too. He can tell you that he is happy
living about the rocky ground where he makes his home. He knows
how to warn of danger, and he talks of the things he likes to eat.</p>

<p>“Dear me, all animals talk! Of course they do! And every sound
they make means something. Our talks must be translated into the language
of people if they’re to understand what we’re saying, but if they
study us and our talk they’ll be able to translate what we have to say.”</p>

<p>“‘If he could only get interested in something,’ said the doctor. ‘He
would then get well twice as quickly. Doesn’t he like to read?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ said his mother, ‘but he is lonely for his friends.’</p>

<p>“But one day on the ledge of the little sleeping porch Peter had,
came a small bird.</p>

<p>“‘What a beautiful voice,’ said Peter, after the little bird had given
a glorious song.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span></p>

<p>“‘Twit, twit,’ answered the little bird. ‘Chirp, chirp, tweet,’ which
was his way of saying he was so glad Peter liked it.</p>

<p>“‘Mother,’ called Peter, ‘may I have some crumbs for this little bird?
He has sung for me and has been here to call on me.’</p>

<p>“Peter’s mother came rushing out with a bowl of bread crumbs and
then she brought out some clear, cool water. The little bird looked
so grateful and pleased, and he went off singing gaily. That morning
seemed very short to Peter, and that afternoon the doctor said that
Peter seemed very much better. The next day seven birds came and
sang and had a delicious repast. And the following day a flock of
birds came—all of many colors and they all had lovely voices. Peter
grew steadily better.</p>

<p>“Peter suddenly thought that the birds would leave him, for the
autumn would take these birds south. Sure enough, they began to
grow fewer and fewer, but his first little friend was the last to leave.</p>

<p>“‘Oh,’ said Peter, ‘you’ve made me well. How I hate to see you
go.’ Peter was walking around now, but he always spent his mornings
in the sleeping porch where the birds came. And Peter waved a
beautiful blue silk handkerchief he had. ‘Good-by little bird friend,’
he called.</p>

<p>“But that afternoon when the doctor came he told Peter’s mother
that Peter was well enough to go back home, so Peter went back with
his friends, ‘The Doctor Birds,’ as he called them.”</p>

may feel very shy in the great barnyard world. And we may want to

come too near to you so you can see me, but I am going to tell you
something. You are growing out of your shells just as boys and girls
grow out of their shoes and their suits and their dresses. They can’t
get back into them again, either, any more than you can get back into
your shells, for that is growth, little chicks, and when you grow to get
bigger and stronger you can’t go back to your babyhood.</p>

go back to the way he was when he was a baby and had to be wheeled

us can do such things, because it isn’t Mother Nature’s way, and Mother
Nature’s way is always the best.</p>

<p class="dropcap">The gold watch was talking to the silver watch and the gun-metal
watch.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m bright in a way,” said the gold watch, “because
I am of gold. But I will tell you first of all why I have done dreadful
things—such as to lose and gain time in a reckless way.</p>

<p>“I was made to look expensive. I cost a lot of money—that is, I
cost a good deal of money. The creature who made me, and the one
who had me made were more anxious to make me look well than to
have me act well.</p>

<p>“They didn’t care what happened to me once I was sold and they
sold me for less than they usually would sell a gold watch for because
I was so cheaply made inside.</p>

<p>“Of course in truth I was very expensive, for I wasn’t worth my
price and that makes an object most tremendously expensive.</p>

<p>“Well, you see, my works were very poor. I was nervous and not
well and strong and so I couldn’t go steadily. One day I’d feel very
fine and I’d go dashing ahead, trying to make up for lost time. That,
of course, a poor watch can never do. It has never been expected of a
watch and so a watch shouldn’t try to do it.</p>

<p>“Time goes right on no matter what we may do. But you see I
would be so silly. I would go ahead so fast that it was as bad as though
I lost time.</p>

<p>“Many were the times when I felt so down-hearted that I just
dragged the hours away—and lost lots of time. The whole trouble
was that I was trying to pretend that I was something I wasn’t. And
that never does. If a creature is what it is and isn’t trying to be something
else, then it is all right.</p>

<p>“I was trying to act like a fine gold watch and I was really a poor
gold watch. I was a humbug, but it wasn’t my fault. It was the fault
of the people who made me. Anyway, now I am here to be fixed up
so I can be what I pretend to be—a timekeeper. But there are people
who don’t appreciate moments! Oh, wasted moments are such a pity
when people could make so much use of them in working or playing—anything
but wasting them! That is what I think is the greatest pity
of all.”</p>

<p>“But one day Fred got sick. Oh, he was such a sick doggie. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
could scarcely wag his tail when his mistress asked him how he was.
He just looked at her out of his big eyes and made queer little sounds
in his throat, which in dog language meant, ‘Don’t worry, kind mistress.
It makes me sad to see you so unhappy.’</p>

<p>“But Fred only grew worse and worse. The dog doctor came, and
said Fred was dying of old age. Poor faithful Fred! How he did
hate to leave his mistress. He seemed to know how much she would
miss him.</p>

<p>“A week passed by and at the end of a long night when Fred had
dozed off and on with his head in his mistress’ lap, his breathing stopped.
And over his shaggy fur the old lady’s tears fell hour after hour.</p>

<p>“Now one day, some little while after Fred had died, the old lady
was sitting by her window looking out on the village street. There
at her door was a big dog—he looked very much like Fred but he was
young and he jumped and bounded.</p>

<p>“‘Scratch! Scratch,’ went his paws on the door, and the old lady
slowly got up and let him in.</p>

<p>“‘Whose doggie are you?’ she asked.</p>

<p>“The dog looked at her for a moment, jumped about and then licked
her hand, as if to say, ‘I am yours, if you will have me.’</p>

<p>“She brought him some milk to drink, and gave him a bone. While
he was playing with his bone, she put on her bonnet and shawl.</p>

<p>“‘Come with me,’ said the old lady. ‘But you mustn’t go too fast.’</p>

<p>“And along the village street they went—the dog going off on short
runs, but always coming back to join his new mistress.</p>

<p>“From house to house, from store to store, they went, and the old
lady’s question was always the same, ‘Do you know from where this
dog came?’</p>

before. But he looks like Fred. Maybe he is one of Fred’s grandchildren—you
had better keep him.’</p>

<p>“‘I shall name you Welcome,’ she said to the dog, ‘for you were
very, very welcome to me. I was so lonely.’ And several tears fell

<p>“He was grayish white in color.</p>

<p>“Then,” daddy continued, “there were examples of different kinds
of trees and of the different creatures who lived in the trees, and of
how they could protect themselves by the color of the nests they made,
and by the safety habits they had.</p>

<p>“For example, the Brown Creeper creeps over the bark of trees which
have much the same coloring as his feathers.</p>

<p>“The Wood Pewee has a nest, bending down, in the tree, shaped
and fixed so that it almost looks like a part of the tree.</p>

<p>“Then the bird called the Least Tern always lays its eggs among the
pebbles on the beach and the eggs and the babies are much the same
color as the pebbles.</p>

<p>“In that way the Least Tern can protect the eggs from the Sea Gulls
who would steal them if they thought they were eggs instead of pebbles.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Night-hawk’s ground nest is made to look like dead leaves
and just like the ground. It is hidden that way. And it made me
think yet again how clever the birds are.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day260">SEPTEMBER 16: Prince, the Horse</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“I have a true story to tell you,” commenced daddy, “of a horse
who wouldn’t be sold!</p>

<p>“The horse’s name was Prince, and he belonged to a farmer
who had six nice little children.</p>

<p>“One day along the road came a man in a big wagon, driving two
horses. The children didn’t like the looks of the man though they
didn’t quite know why, until he said: ‘That’s a fine horse you drove
to town yesterday. I’ll buy him from you for three hundred dollars.’
Now the farmer was not rich—he was really poor, and he needed three
hundred dollars more than he needed Prince.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span></p>

<p>“‘Well,’ he said at last, ‘I’ll sell him to you.’</p>

<p>“The next morning when the farmer got up—very early—for the
children had said their good-bys to Prince, and none of them could bear
to see him go—he went over to the stable and hitched Prince to the
wagon.</p>

<p>“Prince gave a low ‘Whinny-whinny,’ and licked his master’s hand.</p>

<p>“‘Oh Prince, Prince, don’t do that,’ said his master half choking
with tears. And Prince neighed softly.</p>

<p>“They started off, the farmer holding the reins loosely, as if he
couldn’t bear to guide Prince to the town. Prince knew where he was
going and went ahead. But every few minutes he would turn around,
and look at his master, and there were real tears in his big eyes.
‘Prince,’ shouted his master, ‘you’re worth more to us than that
money! Turn around!’ And Prince neighed joyfully this time, as his
master turned him around, and said, ‘Home, Prince, we’re going
home!’”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day261">SEPTEMBER 17: The Deer</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“Far away,” said daddy, “some men went hunting.”</p>

<p>“‘We hope to get a couple of deer,’ they said. ‘And of
course, we’d like it better if we could get more.’</p>

<p>“They thought they were going out for a great deal of fun and they
planned what they should take to eat and what a glorious grown-up
picnic they would have.</p>

<p>“They went hunting on the first day of their trip, and there, sure
enough, was a deer. Oh, such a lovely deer! His eyes were soft
brown in color and very large and beautiful.</p>

<p>“He had left his mate to go hunting for food and here he was caught
by the men. He could not run. He just stood there for one awful
moment, his great eyes looking at the men.</p>

<p>“‘Oh men,’ he was trying to say, ‘oh great, big men with guns,
don’t shoot me down. I do no harm. I am gentle. I have a mate.
I don’t want to be shot. Oh men, you men with guns! You are so
powerful, so strong. What can I do? But have pity on me. Think
of me killed and enjoyed by you as food, and my poor mate crying away
by herself in the woods.’</p>

<p>“‘Sometimes,’ said one of the men, ‘I cannot bear to shoot one of
these lovely creatures. They look so sad. And this one is struck still
with fear.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, nonsense,’ said one of the other men, ‘you always get this way
on the first day of our hunting trip. Think what good venison we will
have.’ For venison is the meat of the deer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span></p>

<p>“And the man’s kindness fled from him and a loud bang-bang ended
the beautiful deer’s life—the deer with the big brown eyes which begged
and pleaded for kindness—not for gunshot.</p>

<p>“The next day the men were off shooting again. They had what
they called a great deal of luck. In truth it means that they killed
some of the woodland animals and could feed on some of the meat.</p>

<p>“They saw deer in great numbers but none of the family of the poor
deer they had killed on the first day.</p>

<p>“On the fifth day of their trip they saw the doe who was the mate
of the deer. She, too, had beautiful soft brown eyes and with her
a lovely fawn child.</p>

<p>“‘Oh look,’ said the men, ‘there is a doe. And a fawn with her.’</p>

<p>“‘There is a fine against us if we kill a mother deer,’ said one.</p>

<p>“‘Who will know?’ said another.</p>

<p>“Now the man who had shown a little bit of kindness on the first
day by feeling badly to kill the deer was the one who spoke next. To
be sure, he had not felt badly enough to have prevented the killing of
the deer, nor had he gone home and given up hunting. But he was like
those people who haven’t the courage to say they don’t want to do a
thing when they know and feel it is cruel and wrong. They just go on
doing it to be thought fine and manly.</p>

<p>“But to continue with the story. The man spoke and this time he
meant what he said.</p>

<p>“‘I cannot bear to kill that mother doe and her lovely fawn. She
is running from us, and I, for one, won’t try to get her.’</p>

<p>“The mother doe and fawn had vanished and were safe back in the
woods. Oh, how her heart was beating. ‘It was those men who killed
my mate,’ she was saying to her fawn child.</p>

<p>“And the fawn nestled close to her mother and licked her head to
tell her how much she was still loved by her child.</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ said the mother deer, ‘I am all alone without my mate, but
I have you safe with me.’</p>

<p>“But for days and days the mother had great trouble in keeping her
child safe from harm. For it was the time when the men were around
with the big guns and the look in their eyes to kill the creatures of the
woods and forests.</p>

<p>“And when the men from the hunting trip I have told you about
went home, one man vowed he would never join them again. And he
kept his word. Neither did he eat any of the venison, for he could
not get from his mind the thought of those great brown eyes begging
for pity from the strong men with the guns. And something deep
within him must have told him of the lonely mate left in the woods,
for never again did he go hunting.”</p>

are almost late to business or are afraid they will be.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh dear,’ said the elevator, ‘I thought they loved me so. Still
it makes no difference. I am but an elevator and I haven’t feelings,
so I shall recover from what you have told me. Anyway I never get
so high up people can’t reach me.</p>

<p>“‘Now there are some creatures who, when they reach high and
lofty positions won’t notice those who are down below them. But not

been stolen by a great big rat. So Mrs. Turkey said to herself:
‘I think I will take a chicken and look after it. Mrs.
Hen won’t mind. She has so many to look after as it is. It will probably
be a great relief to her to have one less.’</p>

<p>“Mrs. Turkey talked on in this way and she called the chicken she
liked best.</p>

<p>“‘Come here to me,’ she said, and she tried to make her voice sound
as a Mother Hen’s would sound.</p>

<p>“The little chicken came running to the side of the turkey and seemed
to be quite happy and contented. The turkey fed the chicken when
she fed her own children and she looked after him all day long.</p>

<p>“But when evening came and the turkeys were ready to go up to the
tree to roost as they always do when night-time comes, the poor little
chicken wished he had not left his own mother.</p>

<p>“‘I was very bad to leave my mother,’ he whispered in a fretful
little voice.</p>

<p>“‘Come on up the tree,’ said Mrs. Turkey, who had reached the
topmost branch. ‘I am ready to go to sleep and all the turkeys are.
We want to put our heads under our wings. We are very sleepy.’</p>

<p>“‘But I can’t get up there,’ said the chicken.</p>

<p>“‘Try,’ said Mrs. Turkey.</p>

<p>“The turkey children began to laugh at the poor little chicken who
couldn’t fly to a branch of the tree.</p>

<p>“‘Gobble, gobble, gobble,’ they said. ‘Can’t you fly?’</p>

<p>“And the little chicken stayed on the ground below looking very
unhappy.</p>

<p>“‘We can’t keep awake any longer,’ said the turkey children.</p>

<p>“‘Go to sleep, my loves,’ said their mother. ‘You are good children
and know how to roost in a tree and have a good night’s rest.’</p>

<p>“‘I could roost and have a sleep too,’ moaned the chicken, ‘if you’d
come down low.’</p>

<p>“‘Now this is annoying,’ said the Mother Turkey. ‘Didn’t I give
you good things to eat and look after you all day?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span></p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ said the chicken.</p>

<p>“‘And didn’t I let you play with my splendid children?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ said the chicken again.</p>

<p>“‘Well, can’t you be grateful and come to bed like a good chicken.
Show you are fine enough to belong to a turkey family.’</p>

<p>“‘But I don’t want to belong to a turkey family! I am a chicken
and I am used to the ways of chickens. I wish I were back home.’</p>

<p>“‘Well, go home then, you little silly,’ said Mrs. Turkey. ‘It’s the
last time I pay a compliment to a chicken by asking to bring him up as
one of my own. You’re not able to fly up to this branch. Shame!’</p>

<p>“‘I’m very thankful for the pleasant day you gave me,’ said the
chicken politely, ‘but I really must be going now. For I’m just a little
bit homesick and I want my Mother Hen.’</p>

<p>“Here the chicken began to cry, and from a short distance away the
turkeys heard a ‘cackle, cackle!’</p>

<p>“Along the ground half walking and half flying as best she could,
came the Mother Hen.</p>

<p>“‘Ah, here you are, my naughty chicken,’ she said, but so happy
was she to find her child that she didn’t scold any more.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, take me home to the chicken roost,’ said the little chicken.</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ said the Mother Turkey. ‘I do not care for your child.’</p>

<p>“‘You had no right to take him away,’ said Mother Hen. ‘If you
weren’t so high up I’d thrash you with my wings.’</p>

<p>“‘I’m afraid you couldn’t in the first place,’ said Mrs. Turkey politely,
‘and in the second place you should be glad I’m ’way up here, because
your child couldn’t fly this far and so got homesick.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, I’ll never leave home again,’ said the chicken as he reached
the chicken roost, which was just right for him. And the Mother
Hen cackled a happy ‘Good Night.’”</p>

right foot and it had been bandaged by the doctor.</p>

<p>“Gyp had been very good while this was done and had
taken his medicine like a little man, or rather, I should say, like a little
monkey.</p>

<p>“But how the bandage did annoy him! He had to stay quite still
and not move his leg at all. That was so hard! He tried to keep
still and yet he longed to play, for the nice liniment which had been
put on the bandage quickly made the horrid foot feel so much better.</p>

<p>“Yes, he was quite sure that if he hadn’t the bandage on he would
be better. And so he tugged at the bandage and got it off.</p>

<p>“Then how the foot did hurt! No longer was it protected by the
soft rags and the soothing liniment! Whew, how it did hurt! And
Gyp did not know what to make of it.</p>

<p>“He felt very sad to think that his foot was really no better, and
there, he had thought it was just about well. He cried a little, for
even though he was a very brave monkey the pain was so hard to bear.</p>

<p>“Now, his master came along and saw what had happened.</p>

<p>“‘You have taken off your bandage,’ he said.</p>

<p>“The monkey did not say anything, but he curled up by his master
and tried with his eyes to say:</p>

<p>“‘The foot aches, the pain is very bad, master.’</p>

<p>“‘I understand,’ said the master. ‘But we must have a fresh bandage.’</p>

was put on Gyp’s foot, and once more the foot began to feel much
much better.</p>

really well this time. It feels better than ever. In fact, there is no
horrid pain there now.’</p>

time he howled, and quickly his master came to him.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, Gyp,’ he said, ‘you’ve worked off that bandage again. Oh,
Gyp, why did you do such a thing?’ And Gyp looked very sad. For
he felt he had been naughty from the tone of his master’s voice, and yet
he hadn’t meant to be. He just had thought his foot was all well, and
the bandage did get in his way and made him stay so still—so awfully
still for a monkey to stay.</p>

<p>“‘We’ll have to have another bandage,’ said his master.</p>

<p>“Pretty soon the doctor came again.</p>

<p>“‘What!’ he exclaimed. ‘You don’t mean to tell me that the monkey
has taken off his bandage again? What a bad monkey.’</p>

didn’t mean to be naughty,’ he said. ‘We must be patient with him, for
he wants to get well.’</p>

<p>“And Gyp, who was watching the other monkey, his chief friend
and companion, playing and jumping and swinging, would have told the
master and doctor if he had known how, that he certainly did not want
to be ill.</p>

<p>“‘Once more, doctor, just once more,’ said the master. ‘This time
the bandage won’t come off.’</p>

<p>“‘How do you know it won’t?’ asked the doctor. ‘In fact, I don’t
see why you don’t say that you know it is bound to come off.’</p>

<p>“‘You bandage it nicely, doctor,’ said the master, ‘and in a moment
I will come back.’</p>

<p>“The doctor bandaged the foot and the monkey was very patient.
The doctor was really kind and talked in gentle tones to Gyp while he
was caring for the foot. That kept Gyp from being frightened. How
fine the bandage and soothing liniment did feel! He knew he would
be all well soon!</p>

<p>“Just then the master came back carrying a little round collar—it
was rather wide and yet it was not at all heavy and rough. He put it
around Gyp’s neck, just holding in Gyp’s arms enough so that he could
not reach his bandage. The wide collar got in his way. But Gyp
understood, and when the foot was all well, off came the collar which
had helped so much.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day275">OCTOBER 1: Gypsy, the Cat</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“Gypsy was a cat,” said daddy, “who had been so named because
she had been picked up one night when she was all alone, and
when she certainly looked as if she had had no home for weeks
and months. She certainly looked as if she had led a gypsy’s life—wandering
and homeless, and she seemed happy indeed to be taken by
little Marian to her nice warm house.</p>

<p>“Marian got home just before dinner time. ‘Ah,’ she thought
to herself, ‘Gypsy will have a nice dinner—not just a meal she has
had to pick up as best she could. It will be a real meal, and she
will have her milk in a fine saucer.</p>

<p>“‘I have brought a cat home,’ said Marian to her mother. ‘I have
named her Gypsy as she is a poor little waif cat, quite homeless and
friendless.’</p>

<p>“Right away Gypsy was given a nice warm bowl of milk. And then
Marian’s family sat down for their dinner.</p>

<p>“Gypsy sat upon a bookcase. ‘Maybe she thinks she looks wise,’
said Marian. And Gypsy blinked her eyes and purred as if to
say, ‘I am a wise cat. I know I have a good home. And I have
the sense to look happy.’</p>

<p>“While Marian and her family were eating Gypsy would look at
them from time to time, but every time any of them turned to look at
her, she would put her head to one side and look off into space.
She seemed to be saying, ‘Maybe I have been a waif but I’m very
proud. And I will not appear to be a beggar.’</p>

<p>“So from that day on, Gypsy always had some milk before Marian
began her dinner. She never begged for food, for she was a Gypsy cat
with a great deal of pride!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day276">OCTOBER 2: The Make-Believe Elephant</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“Lucy,” said daddy, “had her home in a big city apartment
house.”</p>

<p>“Down in the main hallway, on a stand there, was an
elephant. Not a real elephant, for of course a real elephant could
hardly find room on a hallway stand, to say the least. This one was
made out of stone and he was exactly the same color as a real, live
elephant.</p>

<p>“Now often Lucy would come in from dancing class, or from
play, or from school, and she would wonder what it would be like to be
a stone elephant, and she used to feel very sorry for the elephant, always
standing in the hall.</p>

<p>“‘I know,’ she would say, ‘that the elephant isn’t a real, live one,
but just the same, it does seem funny to be always in the same place,
day after day.’</p>

<p>“And then one evening when Lucy was asleep the Dream King sent
the elephant to call on her.</p>

<p>“‘I know,’ the elephant began, without even waiting for Lucy to
make a curtsy as she might have done if he had only given her time,
‘that you have often wondered about me.’</p>

<p>“‘I have,’ said Lucy, ‘it is true.’</p>

<p>“‘But,’ said the elephant, ‘you mustn’t, for I am very happy. The
reason I am happy is because I haven’t the brains or the feelings to be
unhappy because I am always in one place.</p>

<p>“‘If I were a real elephant I would want to go out in the sunshine,
I would want to eat, I would even want to play baseball; perhaps I
would march in parades. But I’m not a real elephant—I’m only a
make-believe one, and I haven’t any feeling at all—no, not a scrap of
feeling.</p>

<p>“‘And I haven’t any brains. I couldn’t even smile at you if you
were awake. It’s the old Dream King who is helping me to smile now.’</p>

<p>“And Lucy noticed that the elephant was smiling, such a funny, droll,
stone-elephant smile.</p>

<p>“‘No, Lucy,’ the elephant continued, ‘you need never feel sorry for
me because I am always in one place. I am like a table or a chair
or a bed—except I am made in the shape of an animal.</p>

<p>“‘It is nice to be a stone elephant if one has always been one,’ it
said, ‘and I suppose it is nice to be a little girl if one has always been
one,’ and it waved its trunk and was gone.”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“Cloudy Wings thought he would like to see the world,”
said daddy. “He had always had a good deal of freedom
but he thought he would like more.</p>

<p>“So this little canary flew out of a window. He wandered about
and flew from bush to bush. Soon it began to rain.</p>

<p>“Cloudy Wings stood under the tree but the rain dripped down over
his little body and his bright yellow feathers were all wet.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, how cold it is,’ thought Cloudy Wings to himself. ‘I can’t
shake off this water as I do my bath water, because it all comes on
me again. And my little Master always puts me in the sun to dry
after my bath. If there is no sun I am put near a stove or where I
can slowly get good and dry. This is awful!’ And he gave miserable
little sounds.</p>

<p>“Of course in the meantime, McLean, his Master, was almost frightened
out of his poor wits. What could have happened to Cloudy
Wings? He saw that a window had been left open, and he knew the
bird must have gone out. He kept the window open hoping Cloudy
Wings would come back, and he sat by the open window, shivering in
the dampness, saying to himself, and trying hard to keep back the
tears:</p>

<p>“‘Oh Cloudy Wings, come back! I want you so! Please come
back, Cloudy Wings!’</p>

<p>“Poor Cloudy Wings, wet and miserable, saw a round glass house,
and beat his wings against the panes of glass.</p>

<p>“An old man was inside looking after his flowers, for the glass
house was a conservatory of flowers and plants. When he saw the
poor little wet bird he opened the door and took him in. Cloudy
Wings sat in his warm hands while the old man smoothed and dried
the little wet feathers.</p>

<p>“‘You belong to the little boy down the road,’ he said to himself.
‘I’ve seen you in the window. I always could tell you by your gray
wings.’ So back in the old man’s pocket Cloudy Wings went to his
Master, and never again did he leave his home.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day278">OCTOBER 4: The Abused Pencil</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“A boy named Gerald,” said daddy, “was finding it very hard
to do his lessons. School had commenced and yet the days
were so lovely it was hard to study.</p>

<p>“He could not draw a map and he was supposed to have one drawn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
for the next day. He found it so hard to remember just how the
places looked on the map and he was supposed to do it from memory.</p>

<p>“He gave up trying the map after a few moments. Then he sat and
chewed the end of his pencil. Perhaps in a moment or two he would
think of all the places he was supposed to mark.</p>

<p>“He decided he would do his arithmetic but he could not manage
the sums. They were all so extremely hard. Much worse than they
had been in the spring, though in reality they were a little easier. The
teacher had known the children had had a long summer and it would
take them a little time to get back into their work.</p>

<p>“He tried to do the sums but couldn’t. What a pity the book had
no answers in the back! And he began to chew the end of his pencil
again while he tried to think.</p>

<p>“Before long he felt he could not do his lessons for he was too tired
and they were entirely too hard. He was dreadfully afraid he would
be put back with the boys a year younger than he was, and yet he couldn’t
do such difficult lessons.</p>

<p>“How ashamed he would be to be put back! Oh dear, what could
he do? He must simply tell the teacher the lessons were too hard.
But then he felt sure she would tell him to go back into a class where
they were easier.</p>

<p>“He put his head down on his arms. The soft autumn breeze
was blowing. It had been a warm day and two bumble-bees were
buzzing and talking very near him. They were having some
sort of a talk about the sweetness of the honey in the honeysuckle
vine.</p>

<p>“Just then he saw his pencil. The end of it was wrapped up in cotton
wool and gauze.</p>

<p>“‘Gracious, pencil, what is the matter?’ asked Gerald.</p>

<p>“‘I shouldn’t think you would ask me what is the matter,’ said the
pencil as it squeaked in a sad little voice.</p>

<p>“‘Why not?’ asked Gerald. But the moment he had asked the question
he knew the answer.</p>

<p>“The pencil answered him just the same. ‘You know I am to do
your work. I will work but I must be guided and directed. I cannot
think. A pencil is not supposed to think. A boy is supposed to do that.
I merely write down what you think is correct, and goodness only knows
I often feel very badly when I have to write down all sorts of wrong
answers.</p>

<p>“‘And when I won’t think for you,’ continued the pencil, ‘this is the
way you abuse me. Think! Don’t bite me to pieces. And I’ll tell
you another thing. You may bite me in two, but never, never will
I do your thinking for you. I am not supposed to and I won’t.’ The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
pencil was certainly very emphatic, Gerald thought, and he decided he
would not argue with it.</p>

<p>“‘I was a lovely red pencil with black lead,’ the pencil continued, in
an injured tone, ‘and now I am all bitten to pieces. One of my ends is
almost useless, and I will break when the lead is used very much further.
Oh, dear! And I was such a nice pencil!’ It sighed and
seemed very mournful.</p>

<p>“Just at that moment the cotton wool came off the pencil and Gerald
saw that he had been sleeping. The pencil had been badly bitten, but
Gerald, now wide awake, put his mind to his studying, and found the
lessons were not so hard after all!”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“We are far more useful than you are,” said the seeds of
the lettuce which were just peeping above the ground in a
box, showing their little green heads. They were in a
schoolroom.</p>

<p>“I can’t help that,” said the geranium plant. “I was never meant to
be useful. I try to be bright and cheerful. I wish I could be useful
but every one can’t be just the same as every one else. Neither can
plants all be the same. Vegetables can’t be plants and plants can’t be
vegetables. But we all have our own reasons for being here.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see,” said one of the onions. They were very small but
were also coming up in a box of their own. And after the onion had
said that, it kept quite still just as if it had completely finished talking.</p>

<p>“You commenced to say something,” said the lettuce. “Why not
finish?”</p>

<p>“Sometimes I get too discouraged to finish,” said the onion. “We
all feel that way at times.”</p>

<p>“And why?” asked the lettuce.</p>

<p>“For you it is different, little lettuce leaves,” said the onion. “You
are a salad when you grow up. You are considered a luxury and a
treat.”</p>

<p>“Don’t people enjoy eating you?” asked the lettuce.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the onion, “they often enjoy eating us. But they won’t
give us any praise for it. They eat us when they’re off by themselves
as if they were a little ashamed of eating us.</p>

<p>“I have often heard folks say,” continued the onion, “‘Oh, I am
ashamed to admit it, but I do like fried onions.’ Then another will
say, ‘Just imagine, little Freddy likes to eat raw onions when they are
small.’ Oh, things like that cut us so,” said the onion. “We like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
to be eaten. All vegetables do, but we would like to be appreciated.”</p>

<p>“If you weren’t appreciated and liked,” said the lettuce politely,
“you wouldn’t be planted and grown. They use you all the time—to
season food and to make things have a nice taste.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” said the onion, which was doing all the talking for the family,
“that is true. But listen to what they always say. They explain
that they like to put a little onion in the soup—not so the soup will
taste of onion—oh, mercy, no—but just to give it a little flavor.
That is what we do. We flavor many a dish, but we don’t get the
credit. Life is full of trials,” ended the onion.</p>

head under her wing. Sometimes she slept this way, just as a
canary bird would sleep. But often she would huddle up on
her perch and doze off with her head drooping down a little on her
chest.</p>

<p>“All of the family were asleep when Trixie seemed to hear in her
dream a strange sound. She pulled her head from under her wing
and looked about her with sleepy eyes.</p>

<p>“Did she see some one way off in the corner? Trixie was frightened.
She did not quite know why. She was never frightened of people, but
this person stayed where it was so dark, and did not light a light—only
a little one that flashed quickly and went right out again.</p>

<p>“When her master came downstairs late at night, he always turned
on the light. But Trixie thought she had better be polite. This was
probably some very queer guest and she must be nice, for all the family
were asleep.</p>

<p>“‘Hello,’ said Trixie. The man grumbled to himself. ‘He didn’t
answer me,’ thought Trixie. ‘I must speak again.’ And this time
she shrieked, ‘Hello.’</p>

<p>“‘Will you keep quiet?’ said the man in a frightened, low voice.</p>

<p>“‘No,’ answered Trixie, ‘never still.’ Now Trixie had said this in
a very loud voice, and from upstairs Trixie’s master heard the parrot.
‘She never says that except when some one is here,’ he said, and he went
downstairs.</p>

<p>“As he reached the room where the parrot was he saw a man hurrying
off—hurrying off before he had had a chance to get anything, for he
had spent his time since Trixie had spoken putting a large coat over
the parrot’s cage.</p>

<p>“The window had been left open and a burglar had come in, but
Trixie, the parrot, had been the cause of his going out.”</p>

could they keep it up?</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, how badly Soot did feel to be so small. He could not
rescue them. He was so very tiny. But he had a voice and he could
run on his little legs. So back into the village he tore as fast as he
could, barking, barking, barking.</p>

<p>“He ran to some men and he stood around them barking and jumping
up and down; his little face looking very sad and worried.</p>

<p>“‘Something must be wrong,’ said one of the men. ‘Let’s go and
see. This dog never acts like this as a rule.’ Soot led them down by
the water and there they saw the upturned boat and the two girls
trying so hard to swim to shore. The men rushed to one of the boat
houses on the shore of the lake. Everything had been closed up, for
the boating season was almost over and very few people went out in
the autumn. The men broke open a boat house and they took a launch
out into the lake. They just reached the two girls in time. In another
three minutes they could not have kept up any longer. They had called
for help but the wind had carried their voices in another direction,
and the only one who had seen them was Soot, their real rescuer!”</p>

<p>“It was night-time, and Alta was sound asleep. And as it was winter-time,
the guinea pigs were in the box in Alta’s room.</p>

And your children, sir, are lovely.’</p>

<p>“That pleased Daddy Guinea Pig so much that he invited Peter
Gnome to look at the children and to play with them. Mother Guinea
Pig was awake now, and as Peter Gnome gently took the little guinea
pigs in his hands, one by one, they squealed sleepily and seemed no
more than little round bits of fuzz.</p>

only asked because I wanted to know and I heard you did.’</p>

‘Of course there are guinea pigs and other creatures who do such things,

<p class="dropcap">October twelfth is not celebrated as a holiday because it was
the day when Christopher Columbus was born, but because it
was supposed to be the date upon which Columbus first stood
upon the ground which forms a part of the continent of America. The
exact date of his birth is not known nor the exact place.</p>

<p>Columbus took many voyages in his life-time; he discovered many
islands and made for himself a great and lasting name in history, but he
never knew he had discovered a new continent! Always he thought
that those places he had touched were parts of Asia.</p>

<p>And it seems quite sad to think of the times we’ve been applauded
(and often, very justly too!) when we’ve recited well or played the
piano well, while Christopher Columbus, who discovered America, did
not even know of the great deed that he had done. Never had he any
realization that in a new continent they would erect monuments to
him, nor that in schools they would give pageants about his trip, his
discouragements, his successes.</p>

<p>And his little son Diego, whom Queen Isabella made a page at the
Spanish Court, could not boast to the others and say,</p>

<p>“My father has discovered a new continent, which is more than can
be said for most fathers, and most people for that matter!”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“Jota, the cat,” said daddy, “was always complaining. First Jota
would leave her milk as if she didn’t like it at all and then she
would upset her little dish filled with bacon.</p>

<p>“There was really nothing in the world the matter with Jota except
that she had been spoiled.</p>

<p>“‘I have some nice milk for you to-day,’ said the cook. ‘It has just
come and it is good and warm.’</p>

<p>“Now Jota was thinking of the mice she had heard scampering in
the cellar. She didn’t want the milk. She would much rather have
mice. And when cook lifted her up and carried her to the corner of
the kitchen where she had put the bowl of milk, Jota scratched as well
as snarled.</p>

<p>“Oh, how badly the cook did feel! Not because the scratch was
such a bad one. No, that amounted to very little, but she felt so hurt
that Jota could have scratched her. She had always been so good to
Jota.</p>

<p>“Jota hurried to the cellar. Yes, now she smelt the mice! Ah,
what a scamper she would have. She did not want milk. No, she
would have mice. She sprang for a mouse. What! It had vanished.
Then she tried for another as it was hurrying across the floor. She
missed the second one. She tried to catch three others and each time
she missed them.</p>

<p>“Jota for once in her life was thoroughly and absolutely ashamed
of herself. She had not been able to catch the mice and she had once
been famous for her powers as a mouse catcher.</p>

<p>“Yes, she had grown lazy and useless. She had been stupid too.
That was all because she had not been unselfish and nice, but had been
horrid to every one. And it had spoiled her. She could not catch
mice!</p>

<p>“Jota was a very sad cat as she slowly climbed the cellar stairs.
She went back into the kitchen and there she drank the milk she had
been so rude and horrid about before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span></p>

<p>“‘Oh, you were thirsty after all,’ said the kind cook. Jota purred
and jumped into the cook’s lap, trying to say:</p>

<p>“‘I know I have been horrid but please forgive me now.’”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“The chipmunks were having a fine time the other day,” said
daddy. ‘Hurry up, hurry up,’ said old Father Chipmunk
to the younger ones. ‘We want all the nuts we can get for
the winter. There will be a long, long, time to eat, and we must hunt
now.’</p>

<p>“Mother Chipmunk was down in her hole in the ground. The
squirrels always have their homes in the holes of trees but the chipmunks
like the ground better. She was teaching all the very little ones
that they must only drink dew-drops. For they are like the rabbit
family, and think that water which has touched the ground is very dangerous
to drink. They will only drink fresh dew-drops and rain water
from leaves and flowers.</p>

<p>“All the little chipmunks hurried and scurried about, and pretty soon
Father Chipmunk said, ‘I will offer a prize for the one who gets the
greatest number of nuts. Hurry, scurry!’</p>

<p>“Chippy Chappy won the prize. ‘It is a house I made out of nuts—a
nice little house of special kinds of nuts,’ said Father Chipmunk,
‘and Chippy Chappy can eat a room whenever he feels hungry! But
now, all of you hurry, and hide your nuts!’ And off they scampered
to their little homes with their winter food.”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“The queen of the fairies said,” began daddy, “‘I have a
scheme. We will visit the clouds.’</p>

<p>“At that the loveliest airships appeared. They looked
almost like clouds themselves, so filmy and white were they.</p>

<p>“So off they sailed, feeling just like birds with the delightful flying
motion of the ships. And up to the silvery clouds they went. When
they got in the clouds the cloud fairies—you know there are fairies
who live in the clouds all the time—took them all around and showed
them their homes. And such homes as they have! They have the
most marvelous palaces, with courtyards and exquisite scenery all about.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
They have tall mountains where they always go for their parties.
Everything is such a beautiful color too, for the cloud fairies are very
fond of pale grays and blues and silver.</p>

<p>“Then the fairies from the woods suggested to the cloud fairies that
they should return their visit and come to earth.</p>

<p>“‘We would love to do that,’ said the cloud fairies. So off they began
to fly from the clouds. They needed no airships but do you know
what happened?</p>

<p>“As they began to drop great big drops of rain fell to the earth, and
then the heaviest kind of a rainstorm began for the earth people, for
of course when the cloud fairies move the rain is not held any more and
it falls to the earth.</p>

<p>“But the fairies from the woods didn’t mind, as the big trees always
protect them, and the cloud fairies only let the rain fall where there
were no trees. So the afternoon was one of greatest pleasure for both
the wood fairies and the cloud fairies.”</p>

<p>“It’s to be a strange story, because it is to be about a mother
dog who looked after some lion babies.”</p>

<p>“A mother dog who looked after lions?” shouted the children.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said daddy, “and you remember I said it was true.</p>

<p>“One time in the circus a mother Lioness grew very, very sick.</p>

<p>“‘I am afraid she will not live,’ said the Keeper.</p>

<p>“‘But whatever will happen to her dear little Lion Babies?’ asked
another man.</p>

<p>“‘I’m sure I don’t know,’ said the Keeper. ‘We will just have to
do the best we can. I have watched her with them a good deal and perhaps
I can look after them.’</p>

<p>“‘She is so fond of them,’ said the other man. ‘What a pity it is
she can’t live.’</p>

<p>“The Lioness seemed to know she could not live. Over and over
again she kissed her little Lion Babies with her tongue. And when she
opened her mouth, her great, cruel teeth could be seen—but the little
babies didn’t know their mother had teeth—so gentle was she with
them.</p>

<p>“And the Lion Babies nestled close to their mother, and by the
little, soft growls they made, they were trying to say, ‘How we love you,
mother! Your fur is so warm, so soft. You are so good to us, mother.
How we love you!’</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span></p>

<p>“And then the Lioness held them closer. And with one of her paws
which could have crushed and killed a creature if she had so wished,
she fondled and petted her babies.</p>

<p>“Slowly as she talked to them in her low, growling way, she began to
see ahead. Her eyes gazed far out of the bars of her cage.</p>

<p>“‘What will happen to my babies when I am not here to look after
them?’ she was thinking. Her eyes stared and stared into space—beyond
the people who passed by every little while to watch the beautiful
mother Lioness and the little Lions.</p>

<p>“And she began to think so hard that she almost forgot her babies.
She was searching with her eyes way, way out into an unknown world,
and wondering, wondering all the time what would happen to her lovely
brood.</p>

<p>“The Lion babies nestled closer. Mother was letting the cold in!
And again she fondled them, while from her eyes that so often looked
treacherous and wicked, great tears fell down on their soft, warm fur.</p>

<p>“The next morning when the Lion Babies woke up there was no
mother Lioness. They couldn’t imagine what had happened. They
saw the big man always around their cage, feeding them, talking to
them in soft, kind tones, but their lovely warm, soft, furry mother,
where was she?</p>

<p>“The day went on and still she didn’t come! Oh, such miserable
little Lion Babies as they were! The Keeper did all he could for them—but
he couldn’t feed them anything to take away that queer feeling
they had. For it wasn’t hunger—it was loneliness! And the Lion
Babies found that no food filled that place!</p>

<p>“But the next morning when the Keeper came to look at the Lion
Babies, there outside the cage was the big, woolly sheep dog. She was
licking the paws of the Lion Babies and they were once again giving their
low growls.</p>

<p>“When the dog saw the Keeper she jumped up and down as if to
say, ‘Let me care for the Lion Babies.’</p>

<p>“The Keeper saw that the Lion Babies were quite gentle with the
dog, and he seemed to know that they wanted to be together—so he
let the dog in the cage.</p>

<p>“Day after day the dog stayed with the Lion Babies, except when she
came out now and again for a run. And the dog brought up the little
lions—and when they were big enough for the circus they always had
the dog with them.”</p>

<p class="dropcap">“A little dog,” said daddy, “was one of five beautiful puppies
living in the country with a very proud and happy mother.</p>

<p>“But, sad to tell, it was not very long before the mother
dog heard her master saying to a friend of his, ‘I simply cannot keep so
many dogs. There is no room for them—not even here in the country.
You see I have as many animals now as I can possibly manage.’</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ said the friend, ‘I will take a puppy for you. I can
keep one easily in our city house. There is plenty of room. I will take
the little white one with the brown right ear.’</p>

<p>“So the little dog named Max was taken to the city. He was dreadfully
homesick and one day when he was being taken for a walk led
by a leash he escaped.</p>

<p>“Such adventures as he had. He remembered the trip he had taken
with his new master. First they had gone on a ferry boat across some
water—and then on a train. So Max ran and ran until he reached
the railroad station. He got through the gate when the guard wasn’t
looking and he jumped up into the baggage car just as the train was
pulling out.</p>

<p>“On and on he rode until he saw some water and a great boat—just
like the one he had been on before. What should he do? Jump?
The train was going fast, but it stopped where the ferry boats were.
And so Max reached home and his mother—and somehow or other
room was made for him by his first master.”</p>

‘There! A little faster, but no shoving. We must all see
how calm we can be. It is only when we become frightened that there

people and they said that it was raining pitchforks. Now can you imagine
us doing that? We wouldn’t rain pitchforks for anything.
They’d hurt people and children and animals, and while we do love
to splash and have our jokes, still we would never do anything mean
such as rain pitchforks.”</p>

<p>“Of course you wouldn’t,” said the King of the Clouds. “They say
that in just the same way as they say it is ‘raining cats and dogs.’

trips with his cat friends who lived down the street.</p>

<p>“Now Tiger West lived in great grandeur. He had a
special bed of cushions and a blanket to curl under. He had a rug
of white, soft, fluffy material which he could lie upon whenever he
wanted. And he wore a beautiful bow to match his mistress’ gown.</p>

<p>“His master was a very rich man, and Tiger West was used to the
best of food. But he had missed adventures and when he became
friendly with the cats down the street he certainly did have enough.
He narrowly escaped having horrid cold water thrown on him from
an upper window one time, because he had been getting some goodies
out of an ash tin. ‘Meow,’ he said to himself, ‘what a joke it would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
be if the master could see me with my whiskers quite dirty and my
beautiful fur ruffled up. Well, I know how to make myself look like
a gentleman cat when I am ready to go home.’</p>

<p>“Days passed and Tiger West still went on trips with his cat friends.
One day there was to be a meeting on the back fence of the cats of the
neighborhood, and Tiger West was asked to be present. Now, Mr.
Black Cat was very different looking from Tiger West. Mr. Black
Cat’s fur was not handsome, and he had a thin look, not at all becoming
to a cat. He looked as though he had to hunt for his food and
had to exercise entirely too soon after eating. Tiger imagined he must
have been chased away after every meal he took.</p>

<p>“Still Mr. Black Cat was a leader in the cat neighborhood. He was
President of the Night Singing Club, Vice-President of the Ash Can
Visitors, Secretary of the Hunt Mice Club, and Treasurer of the Garbage
Guild. He was always chosen as the judge of all the trials held
in the cat neighborhood and for this reason he was always called ‘Your
Honor.’</p>

<p>“Now it made Tiger West very much annoyed to hear such a common
cat called by such a fine name. ‘Do you like strawberries and cream?’
he asked.</p>

<p>“‘Never ate any,’ said Mr. Black Cat.</p>

<p>“‘I do,’ said Tiger West, ‘and I eat them in and out of season.
My master always gets them for me, or else he gets something else
that is nice for my breakfast with cream.’</p>

<p>“‘It doesn’t satisfy my hunger to hear what you have had to eat,’
said Mr. Black Cat.</p>

<p>“Still Tiger West wanted to show that he amounted to something
and was better than Mr. Black Cat. ‘I never eat any kind of meat
on a chicken but the tenderest white meat,’ he said. ‘And I am particularly
fond of ice-cream. I like all the best food, and I get it too.’</p>

<p>“Mr. Black Cat raised his back and snarled. ‘This cat,’ he said,
‘tries to be superior to us. Let’s put him out of the club.’</p>

<p>“The cats were chasing Tiger West now, but he got away from them
and back home. ‘How foolish I was,’ he said to himself as he began
to drink a bowl of rich milk, ‘to leave a home like this for such terrifying
adventures. But my curiosity is satisfied, and now I will stay
home and live in luxury as I should.’”</p>

her, and when she stopped to gather ferns and lovely wild flowers,
Blackie would romp through the fields, playing and chasing his shadow,
sticks, and sometimes his tail!</p>

lantern show she was going to give for some of her little friends that
evening.</p>

scamper over the hills and then he decided that he would go and see
some of the other dogs in the village where Doris lived. He thought
perhaps they would like to take a run, and it would be so much more
fun to have companions. He knew his mistress would not be able
to leave the house for she had told him so, and Blackie always understood.</p>

<p>“He went up into the village and before he had met any of his
special friends he came across a big bone. He had met several dogs
he knew well enough to sniff at and wag his tail to as he went by, but
he was waiting to see some of his really good friends when he happened
upon the bone.</p>

<p>“‘This looks good,’ he said to himself. ‘I do believe I’ll take it
home and spend the afternoon munching on the bone.’</p>

<p>“Blackie ran home and into the side yard. What a time he did have,
but it was not long before Doris saw him.</p>

<p>“‘What, back again?’ she said. And Blackie wagged his tail.
‘Maybe I’ll get through in time for a little scamper.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span></p>

<p>“Of course Blackie knew perfectly well what a scamper meant and
he barked delightedly.</p>

<p>“Somehow it had a peculiar look and a very peculiar odor and in
a moment Doris thought of poison. That was always the danger about
bones that were found. She thought to herself, as she took the
bone and looked at it, that there have been people cruel enough to put
poison around on bones so dogs would eat it.</p>

<p>“She threw the bone away and though Blackie looked very much
disappointed he knew that it must be quite a horrid bone if his mistress
wouldn’t let him have it. For she knew how much he loved bones and
would never take it away from him if she didn’t have to do so.</p>

<p>“‘I think I’ll be able to leave now,’ said Doris. For the bone still
worried her and she thought perhaps it would be good for Blackie to
have a run.</p>

<p>“Blackie was very happy again, but when they were a little way out
of the village, Blackie didn’t seem to want to run, and he stopped every
few moments to eat grass. Dogs usually do that when they are feeling
ill.</p>

<p>“Again Doris thought of the bone and how worried she was.
Blackie didn’t want to run, and was so unlike himself.</p>

<p>“Pretty soon she decided to go home and Blackie seemed very glad
of that. She telephoned her little friends and said that the magic lantern
show would be put off for Blackie was ill.</p>

<p>“How badly they all felt, for they knew how much she loved Blackie.
But she didn’t forget about the other little dogs. She told all her
friends to watch their pets, for she imagined a cruel person who
wanted to poison dogs was around.</p>

<p>“During the evening Blackie grew worse! Oh, how sick he was!
He was so hot, and Doris kept sponging his head with cool water.
He would look at her out of his brown eyes and tell her how grateful
he was, and he would try to say that he did not want to leave his
mistress—life had been so happy for him.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, Blackie,’ whispered Doris, as she bathed his head, and as her
tears rolled down on his black shaggy hairs, ‘would they kill little dogs
who are people’s pets—just because they are so mean and don’t know
what it is to understand and love an animal? And they put the
poison around anywhere so that the good are just as apt to eat it as
perhaps one dog who is naughty.’</p>

<p>“But Blackie got well, and perhaps the cruel person heard about it,
for there was no more dog poisoning in that village.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day301">OCTOBER 27: A Talk with the Sun</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“A little boy named Melville,” said daddy, “had heard that
day that every one should make hay while the sun was
shining.</p>

<p>“‘Make hay while the sun shines,’ was what Melville had been told.
The one who had told him this was his teacher in school.</p>

<p>“How could any one make hay in the winter time and the sun shone
in the winter time as well as in the summer time? he thought.</p>

<p>“He wondered about it more and more as he felt the warmth of
Mr. Sun shining into his window. He was sitting curled up in a big
arm chair.</p>

<p>“How he wished he could ask Mr. Sun what it meant. Of course
he could ask his teacher to-morrow. There must be some meaning to
it, or some catch to it which he didn’t understand.</p>

<p>“Mr. Sun looked very pleasant and as though he would be quite
willing to tell Melville if only Melville knew how to ask him so he
would hear.</p>

<p>“How nice and warm Mr. Sun was. More and more sleepy did
Melville become, and after a few moments he was sound asleep. Then
it seemed as though Mr. Sun came and sat on the window sill. ‘It is
true,’ said Mr. Sun, ‘that one can only make hay when the season
allows it, and the season doesn’t allow it when it is winter, most assuredly.</p>

<p>“‘But the expression, “Make hay while the sun shines,” has nothing
to do with the seasons.</p>

<p>“‘It is simply an expression meaning to take advantage of the good
weather or the good time or the good season and prepare for ones
which aren’t so good.</p>

<p>“‘For example, when daddies and mothers are well and strong they
try to save a little money for the days when illness may come. That
is making hay while the sun shines, for they’re saving during the time
when they get a chance to save.</p>

<p>“‘When children study when they’re young they’re making hay while
the sun shines for they’re taking advantage of the opportunities they
have which will make them wise when they’re men and women.</p>

<p>“‘When people are wise and take advantage of time it is making
hay while the sun shines, for it is not losing time. The expression,
as you see, means taking advantage of good times to prepare for bad
times, and it started by some one telling some one else to see about the
hay while the sun was shining, for the rain might come, and then it
would be too late.</p>

<p>“‘And,’ continued the sun, ‘it is a wise saying, a very wise saying,
indeed.’”</p>

<p class="dropcap">“It’s all right to be a winter vegetable or to be a summer vegetable,
and it’s all right to be any kind of a vegetable at all a vegetable
wishes to be,” said the squash, “but it’s sad above everything to
be a squash.”</p>

<p>“And why so?” asked one of the potatoes.</p>

<p>“Because there is something flat about being a squash.</p>

<p>“Just think of the family name, for example—squash! Doesn’t it
sound flat and squashed and trampled upon and walked upon and
squashed down flat? It has such a hopeless sound!”</p>

<p>“It does sound that way,” said the potato. “But still you aren’t all
trampled upon and squashed down flat. In fact, I don’t know that I
ever saw folks going around and trampling upon you. To be sure,
your name has a flat, trampled-upon sound.”</p>

<p>“And, oh, dear,” said the squash, “we’re such a dull sort of family.
There is no interest to us. We’re not fascinating and pretty, like the
tomatoes, and we’re not even loved by some and hated by others, like
the cucumbers.</p>

<p>“They are interesting, for they have both friends and enemies.</p>

<p>“Now we haven’t any who really love us. Most people think we’ll
do and that we do no harm and that we’re all right, but no one even gets
excited over squash. It is indeed sad to be nothing but a squash!”</p>

my mouth. It is such a nice big mouth.”</p>

<p>“It is a nice big mouth,” laughed Billie Brownie. “Yes, I think
you’re a fine fellow, and I love the head piece of a bit of green stalk
you wear at the top of your head. It makes you look quite dashing.</p>

<p>“Yes, I will go calling on many people, and I will sit on their door-steps
all by myself with no one to tell me what to do and no one to
tell me how to act.</p>

<p>“For I will know how to act. I will smile at the people and that
is why I am glad my mouth is big, for if I hadn’t a big mouth I
mightn’t look as though I were smiling. I mightn’t look as though I

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day304">OCTOBER 30: Daddy’s Hallowe’en</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“I am going to tell you,” said daddy, “of the things I did when I
was a boy at Hallowe’en time. First of all I used to love
bobbing in a tub for apples. I wore a bathing cap so if
it was a cold evening my mother wouldn’t be afraid I’d get my hair wet
and catch cold because she knew how far down I’d dive into the tub
of water!</p>

<p>“And we all did the same. The girls needed the bathing caps on
their heads more than the boys did and they certainly could dive with
hair all held in so dry and safe by their caps.</p>

<p>“Then we would play games and one of our favorite games was to
run races carrying peanuts on knives.</p>

<p>“Two at a time would race against each other. The end of the
race would be a big bowl set on the floor and we would start off at the
other end of the room.</p>

<p>“Then we would each have a lot of peanuts and we would carry as
many as we could on our knife until we had gotten rid of all of them.</p>

<p>“We had to take all the peanuts to the bowl without letting any
drop off.</p>

<p>“It was most exciting, for though none of the other children could
push us or joggle us they could make funny remarks to us and we would
start laughing and sometimes our knife would shake and we’d drop the
peanuts and have to start all over again.</p>

<p>“Sometimes we would only take one at a time because we could get
them all to the bowl more quickly that way in the long run.</p>

<p>“Sometimes the one who starts off fastest does not win, you know.
And then of course we went calling each with a Jack O’Lantern, and
how mad we were at those who hadn’t enough fun in them to like these
Hallowe’en callers!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day305">OCTOBER 31: Hallowe’en</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">The preparations for the party to be given at Janet’s house
that Hallowe’en evening had already begun. Already they
were hanging apples attached firmly by strings from a door-way
and as soon as the guests came and the tricks began they would all
try to bite these apples, which would swing so annoyingly away from
them!</p>

<p>And there was going to be a dish of flour in the kitchen after supper
and the children were all going to try to find a twenty-five cent piece
hidden there. They were going to hunt for it with their teeth! And
there were apples bobbing in a great tub of water. And these had to be
caught by the teeth too. Some of these held pennies!</p>

<p>There would be fortune-telling, too, and Janet’s mother had promised
to be the fortune-telling witch who would sit by her caldron which was
now being made of red cheese-cloth. At the bottom of it, barely hidden,
there would be a flashlight which would be kept going all the time,
of course!</p>

<p>Oh, the party was going to be splendid. Janet knew that. And
yet—and yet—she wished she knew why they had a party—not that
she didn’t want a party! But just why was it for this evening with
the strange name. What did Hallowe’en really mean? She hated
to ask for she felt she should know and that she would be laughed
at for not knowing.</p>

<p>“Why, Janet,” her mother said that afternoon late as she caught
sight of Janet’s little worried face, “this isn’t the time to look sad when
we’re having a party! What is the trouble, my darling?”</p>

<p>There was something in the understanding, sweet way that her mother
asked her that made Janet ask what she thought was so foolish a
question.</p>

<p>“Mother dear,” she began, “just what does Hallowe’en mean?”</p>

<p>“October thirty-first,” her mother said, “is the vigil of All Saints’
Day, or Hallowe’en, for Hallow means to devote time to holy purposes
and e’en is short for evening. So that it means the evening before
the religious day which is known as All Saints’ Day.</p>

<p>“But Hallowe’en, while coming before a religious day, has always
been an evening of festivity and frolic and fun for children. In all
countries they celebrate it—it is a real children’s evening—though in
various countries the children have their own little ways of celebrating.</p>

<p>“Our way, though, is used by children of many countries and we
have make-believe witches just as they have, for in the olden days in the
old countries those who were superstitious or given to imagining things
not so, thought witches came out on Hallowe’en.”</p>

<p>And somehow, Janet never enjoyed a party so much, for it was so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
nice to know just what the day meant and to know too that in many
countries children on this very evening were having a celebration of such
a weirdly wonderful kind!</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“A little girl, whose name was Kitty, was very anxious to
win the prize,” said daddy. “‘I shall work so hard over it,’
she said to herself, and she refused an invitation to walk
with her friends that afternoon.</p>

<p>“She put her hand to her head and thought hard—but she couldn’t
think of anything to write! She dipped her pen into the ink-well and
only made two smudge spots on the paper in front of her.</p>

<p>“‘Oh,’ she sighed, ‘I wish I had gone for a walk. I feel so sleepy—and
staying in the house all afternoon is so silly!’ She really was
much annoyed with herself and soon she put her head down on her
desk and went sound, sound asleep.</p>

<p>“Pretty soon the two smudge spots grew larger and larger. They
seemed to get round and funny and fat—and she almost saw them grinning
at her!</p>

<p>“Soon she saw that around one spot was a wide band of white on
which were written the words:</p>

<p>“‘I’m Mr. Pen and I’ll write you a story.’</p>

<p>“And around the other spot was written:</p>

<p>“‘I’m Mr. Ink and I’ll write you a story.’</p>

<p>“‘But I don’t want two stories,’ cried Kitty. ‘I only want one. If
I write two they will think I want to have two chances while every one
else has one. That will never do.’</p>

<p>“But the round, smudgy spots proved to be Billie Brownie and
Bennie Brownie, and it was around their hats that the words were
written about Mr. Pen and Mr. Ink.</p>

<p>“‘We are going to whisper to you the most marvelous of
stories,’ they said. And they grinned and hugged each other with
delight.</p>

<p>“‘She’ll win the prize,’ said Billie Brownie, and his brother Bennie
laughed and said:</p>

<p>“‘She certainly will.’</p>

<p>“And then they told her, while she was napping, the most wonderful
story you can imagine. ‘I won’t forget it, will I?’ she asked. And
the two Brownies laughed and said:</p>

<p>“‘Forget one of your stories? Never!’</p>

<p>“And then Kitty stretched out her arms until one hand was taking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
hold of Mr. Pen and the other was bringing Mr. Ink’s Home—the ink-well—forward
on the desk.</p>

<p>“‘Ah,’ she said, as she rubbed her eyes and looked at the paper in
front of her. ‘What a nice sleep I have had. I feel so fresh and just
like writing a composition. I am so glad I didn’t go out—for I know
just what I want to write about.’</p>

<p>“Kitty wrote all the afternoon and the very last thing she did was
to make a nice, neat copy of the composition. When it was all ready
and tied with a little piece of blue string at the top, she put it away in
her desk drawer until the time came to hand it in.</p>

<p>“Of course, she won the prize and the teacher said that it was because
her composition showed she had taken time to think about it, but Kitty
knew it was because of the Brownies!”</p>

people have almost become used to cold weather.”</p>

<p>“But,” said the golden butterfly, “how do you know you’re improving
each shining hour? Aren’t the hours all right as they are?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the bumble-bee, “that may be so, and they may be all
right spent idly by some people. I don’t suppose the hours care so very
much, though I have heard they hated to be wasted, and we will never
waste them.”</p>

<p>“But they like to give pleasure and to have people take rests and
enjoy themselves, too,” said the golden butterfly. And as he waved
a golden wing in farewell he said to himself, “Bumble-bees overdo

anxious to have me working again.</p>

<p>“And I believe they never gave me a moment’s thought all summer
long. I’m sure they didn’t. I feel quite certain of it.</p>

<p>“And then they wonder why at times I act crossly and queerly and
why I get upset at times. I try not to, but of course when I get thinking
of how no one gives the poor old Furnace a thought all summer
long, then I can’t help but get upset.</p>

<p>“And when I get upset they all grumble about me, as if I mustn’t
get upset, no matter how I may feel.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s a bit unfair. But I try to rise above it and give them
heat and no smoke; warmth and no trouble.</p>

<p>“I suppose things aren’t appreciated until they are needed. I’ve
heard that window-shades or blinds or whatever one wants to call them
have been so good about hiding the light from people’s eyes when
they were sleepy, and then when they are old and had holes in them,
they were horribly complained about, though never a ‘thank you’ did
they get when they were doing their good work.</p>

<p>“And no one ever says:</p>

<p>“‘Ah, what a good pair of socks you are, my dear,’ or, ‘What a
lovely pair of stockings you are, Nice Pair.’</p>

<p>“Yet so soon as a hole comes, how they grumble!”</p>

<p>“You’re very useful,” said a piece of coal, “but you aren’t the whole
thing. We’re all needed. Matches are needed. Sticks and paper
are needed when you are started. Some one is needed to watch over
you.</p>

<p>“You require a great deal of watching. You must have a nurse, or
furnace man, or watcher of some sort looking after you.</p>

thought the coal was right.</p>

<p class="dropcap">“Steve, the elephant,” said daddy, “wanted to take a bath. He
was in the big theater when he had this wish, for he did an
act every afternoon and evening on the stage.</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ Steve said to himself, ‘I feel the need of bathing. I’d like a
good plunge in the real water—a river for example, just as I would have
if I were free.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span></p>

<p>“‘Of course, the first thing I must do,’ he continued, ‘is to get out of
that side door there and get on the street. Then I will go a-looking
for a river.</p>

<p>“‘I know there are plenty of rivers, for in my five years of circus life
I’ve seen quantities of rivers. Yes, there must be one not far from
this theater. It seems to me on one of my marches that I remember
seeing it.</p>

<p>“‘In fact, I feel quite sure I remember seeing a river at the other
end of the long street we marched through.</p>

<p>“‘At any rate, I will go and have a look.’</p>

<p>“So Steve started to go through the door at the end of the lower part
of the stage where he was staying waiting for his act to go on. There
would be other acts first and then he would come.</p>

<p>“‘I’ll be back in time,’ he said to himself, ‘but if not I’ll be just having
a holiday. Of course, usually holidays are given to people and animals,
but this time I will take my own holiday all of my own accord.’</p>

<p>“Instead of undoing the door or opening it in the usual way Steve
walked along pushing the door in front of him and taking it right off
its hinges.</p>

<p>“When he got out on the street he looked about him. The children
were just coming from school.</p>

<p>“‘Well, hello, children,’ he said, as he waved his trunk around.
Some of the children had peanuts with them and some of them had
pennies so they threw delicacies to Steve and said:</p>

<p>“‘Oh, aren’t you a nice big elephant.’</p>

<p>“But when their mothers saw that the elephant was walking along
they called to their children to come right in the houses.</p>

<p>“‘He is nice,’ the children called back.</p>

<p>“‘You can’t be sure,’ said their mothers.</p>

<p>“‘Now isn’t that annoying,’ said Steve. ‘Here I am feeling as
friendly as friendly as can be, and the mothers want their children
to come away from me and to go into foolish houses.</p>

<p>“‘I don’t want to go into houses. They needn’t bang their doors so
tight shut. Haven’t I just left a house and don’t I want a bath?</p>

<p>“‘I don’t take a bath by going in people’s houses. I’ve heard of
the size of their bath tubs. They wouldn’t do for me.’</p>

<p>“Steve suddenly discovered a river at the end of another few blocks.</p>

<p>“He hurried along, waving his trunk as he went, and oh, what joy it
was to him, to take a real swim in a real river. By the time he had
finished his keepers had come after him, but he didn’t mind going back
again to do his tricks in the theater for he had had a bath in a real
river!”</p>

outskirts of the town. It was quite near some houses and
an inn. So the firemen wanted to do all they could to keep
fire from spreading to the houses, for there was quite a high wind.
No one minded if the old barn burnt, for it really was of no use to any
one, and the owner of it never bothered to keep it up at all.</p>

<p>“But the fire-engine horses made an awful fuss. They heard, what
the firemen didn’t hear, one of their own kind crying for help in horse
language.</p>

<p>“They tried to break from the engines and kicked their heels and made
a lot of commotion. They shook their heads and made all sorts of
funny sounds.</p>

I am going in to investigate, for maybe there is something alive inside.
I have never known these horses to make a mistake.’</p>

<p>“So he went in through a broken window, and when he got inside he
found a horse trembling with fear at seeing the flames.</p>

<p>“The old fireman unbolted the back door of the barn where the fire
had not as yet spread and led the horse out. Then you should have seen
the fire-engine horses. They were so happy that the old horse had been
saved.</p>

<p>“And when he saw that his horse had been saved he went over and put
his head on the horse’s mane, and the horse neighed contentedly.</p>

<p>“The old man had stopped at the inn for the night, and there they
had told him he could safely keep his horse in the old barn.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, I am so grateful to you!’ said the old man to the firemen.
‘I love my horse like a very real friend. How can I ever thank you?’</p>

<p>“‘We’re not the ones to thank,’ said the fireman who had gone in
the barn when the fire horses had seemed so excited. ‘Our horses saved
your horse’s life.’”</p>

<p class="dropcap">“Have I ever met you before?” asked the yellow rose of a
beautiful pink rose. The pink rose was of a very exquisite
color and though the yellow rose had seen many pink roses
it was sure it hadn’t seen one of just that very same shade.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you have,” said the pink rose, “for I am a new kind of
a rose. I haven’t any thorns on me—that is, I only have some way,
way down by the bottom of my stem. That is what they have trained
my family to do. It took a good deal of training and teaching to make
us like that and last spring when my grandmother made her appearance
she was the first one to have succeeded in being almost thornless. It
was a great day for grandmother!”</p>

<p>“It is really most ridiculous. One would think they would prefer it
where it was cool.”</p>

<p>“Still,” said the second Moth Ball, “we do not go to cool spots in the
summer. We stay right in with the warm clothes.”</p>

<p>“That is so,” the first Moth Ball answered, “but we have our work
to do. Our business keeps us in warm clothes in the summer-time, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
you’d think moths would stay away, when they can see there is no hospitality
offered them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” the second Moth Ball said, “I suppose there are some
creatures who will never take hints and perhaps it is just as well.</p>

coat about to begin its second winter.</p>

his good-winter calls on some of his friends.</p>

<p class="dropcap">“When I went out to-day,” began the horse, “the farmer
had a new check rein for me. It held my head way, way
up in the air and it was so hard for me. My neck ached
and throbbed, and still the farmer drove me along and never paid any
attention.</p>

<p>“I just longed to have him wear it for five minutes and see how he
would feel. But we had not gone so very far when a lady stopped and
spoke to the master.</p>

<p>“‘That check rein is very tight,’ she said.</p>

<p>“‘Oh no,’ said the master. ‘He is used to a rein like that. He
always keeps his head up that way. He is a fine, well-bred horse.’</p>

<p>“‘That’s true,’ said the lady. ‘But that is no reason why you should
make him suffer.’</p>

<p>“‘He doesn’t suffer,’ said the master. And all the time my neck was
aching, aching, and, oh, how I was longing to get my head down a little.
The rein held it up, and never for a moment could I get it down.</p>

<p>“Before another word was said, my check rein was loosened, and then
joy of joys, I put my head down. I moved it around, and twisted it,
and I shook it! It was glorious.</p>

<p>“‘There,’ said the lady. ‘Don’t you see he likes his head down? He
doesn’t want it forced up beyond where he would hold it naturally.
That is a very cruel rein.’</p>

<p>“‘You know nothing about horses,’ said my master as he put the
check rein back.</p>

<p>“There was my head back in its cruel check rein again, and on we
drove. Oh how long that drive to town and back seemed to-day.
And though I wish the master no harm, how I do wish he could be driven
into town just once—with his head way back—held—so he couldn’t
move it—couldn’t let it down for a second! Then he would know what
it means to a horse who has too tight a check rein.”</p>

<p>“Then he would know,” neighed the other horses. “Oh, if masters
could only wear check reins too, so they would know just what they are
like,” they added.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day316">NOVEMBER 11: Armistice Day</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">We think of days in history and of great and important events
and of the dates upon which they took place. And little do
we realize that one of the greatest dates in history was one
which almost all of us remember. Those who were only babies then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
are so quickly catching up with those ahead of them that they will hear
about it so often that they will feel they, too, remember.</p>

<p>Early, early in the morning of November 11, 1918, peace came to a
world in which so many nations had been at war that it was indeed almost
a world war. And so huge and terrible and gigantic a war was it, including
men of so many countries, and so great was the ideal for which
they were fighting against an aggressive tyranny, that it had to be
known by some name quite unusual and quite different.</p>

<p>It was also called The Great War.</p>

<p>It was great in its immensity, its idealism, its heroism, its scientifically
modern and horrible machine-guns and submarines and gases, its tragedy,
its suffering and the confusion and disorder it left behind.</p>

<p>There had been on November 7th a false report of peace. At that
false report (then people did not know that it was false) every one
went wild. The streets were filled with singing, shouting, happy, excited
people. Oh, how happy they were! So happy they couldn’t
quite express their happiness. They had kept their worries and their
sorrows so closely to themselves that they found it hard at first to let
out what they felt.</p>

<p>And let it out they must! Joy was not to be kept to themselves.
Joy was to be shared. Joy was something one didn’t have to be brave
about—joy was too kindly and gay and merry—joy didn’t demand any
self-control, nor did joy demand anything that was hard!</p>

<p>Whistles were blown and bells began to ring. Flags began appearing
from windows, flags of all sizes. Many people rushed from
their houses to wave their flags as they ran joyously up and down the
streets.</p>

<p>One gray-haired woman spent the day in waving her flag as she
walked the streets and smiled at people she had never met before.
But now she could share her happiness with these strangers.</p>

<p>Her son, who had been fighting for them, too, was now safe!</p>

<p>People made very sure of the report that came next—on November
11th—but it was a real report and there was no doubt of it this time.
Victory had come. But not only victory—peace! The very word itself
was more deeply thrilling than ever it had been before.</p>

<p>In the cities the people took to the streets and shared their joy with
everybody. They rode on trucks; in every motor there were crowds—many
of them had been strangers to each other but a short time ago.
Older women seemed to have grown suddenly younger. They walked
with a new springiness in their steps. People sang—crowds went by
having made up hurried parades, singing as they went.</p>

<p>Even tin pans were brought out and did their share toward a great
noise in thankfulness. Peace! Peace following war!</p>

<p>People dressed up—solemn people were no longer solemn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span></p>

<p>And all were a part of a great day in history—one of history’s greatest
days!</p>

<p>In small towns too the whistles blew, the church bells rang and very
early in the dark morning, lights appeared in the houses. Small village
bands or a group who could play musical instruments led processions
which kept on all through the day and up into the following night.
The small towns too had sent their own to the war. And peace had
come to the small towns.</p>

<p>November 11th—Armistice Day! Peace! Something so beautiful,
meaning so much to all human beings, that it has become the hope of
the world that peace may always be with us!</p>

<p>Chilly and the other Frost brothers and workers were delighted.
“You see, Mr. Sun, they like us.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe they do,” said Mr. Sun, “but I can’t help you stay
around. I must smile and talk in my usual way and it’s too warm
a day for you to like.”</p>

<p>Slowly the frost castles left the windows, for they were taken away

never teach any one else the mystery of their work.</p>

<p>“Nutty Chum, Chippy Chappy, and Sharpy and Bright Eyes
and others of the squirrel family will be glad that we have come, for
we will improve the nuts and they like the nuts, oh yes indeed!</p>

<p>“Then we will please the children, too, for they like the chestnut season.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
Oh, yes, that is the truth! They do like the chestnut season.</p>

<p>“But ah, Frost Brothers, the night is almost here. Let’s get started.</p>

<p>“Remember, you all know just what you have to do! You all know
which of you must paint the windows with the magic Frost paint brushes
this evening, and you know which of you must whisper to the flowers
the little Frost word, ‘Obey!’ You all know what you must do.”</p>

<p>“We all know,” said the Frost Brothers.</p>

<p>“I feel just like work,” said Master Very Cool.</p>

<p>“So do I,” said Master Chilly.</p>

<p>“I feel like it, too, I should say I did,” agreed Master Heavy Frost.</p>

<p>“Good,” said Jack Frost. “And you’re a fine worker, Master Heavy
Frost. You make creatures obey you!”</p>

<p>So off went the Frost Brothers, and the next morning when the people
awoke they said what a heavy frost there had been, but Jack Frost was
chuckling to himself as he said: “The Autumn Paint Club did fine
work last night!”</p>

sleepers. We shall sleep especially well if it is to be a cold
winter. Ah, my children, what marketing trips we have made. I have
not had to call in a neighbor to take care of my babies when I went
out. No, my babies hung onto my neck and came along, too.</p>

<p>“What times we used to have catching bugs and other delicious delicacies
we found about at night. What meals we used to have.</p>

<p>“We used to have beetle pudding quite often and gnat salad. Do
you remember, my Bat babies?”</p>

<p>“We remember, Mother Brown Bat. But,” they said, “we are no
longer babies.”</p>

<p>“That is true,” said Mother Brown Bat, “and you are able to look
after yourselves; but I still call you babies, for it is hard for a mother
to realize her children are grown-up and you do grow up so quickly.</p>

<p>“Sometimes we went about in the very, very early mornings and often
we started out before it was really night. But we took great care, for
we kept away from people. People have such a curious habit of not
liking bats.”</p>

<p>“That is hard to believe,” said the Bat children.</p>

the Mr. Brown Bat and the little Brown Bats wouldn’t half appreciate
it either.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day320">NOVEMBER 15: The Magic Slate</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“There was once,” said Witty Witch, as she sat in the center
of old Mr. Giant’s cave, and told stories to the elves,
brownies, gnomes, goblins and many of her other little
friends, “a very naughty little gnome.</p>

<p>“‘I think slates are the nicest things in the world,’ he said. ‘Anything
we write or draw on them we can rub right out again. I guess
I’ll be like a slate myself. I’ll do what I please and then I’ll rub
it out.’</p>

<p>“Of course he didn’t quite know how he was to do that. Rubbing
out chalk marks on his slate he found to be quite a different matter
from rubbing out mean and naughty actions!</p>

<p>“Still he said to himself that he would never do the same naughty
things again, and that he was sorry, and that was just about the same
as rubbing them out.</p>

<p>“He always pretended in school that he knew the answer to every
question. Then, when Professor Gnome would ask what he had
written, he would say, ‘Oh, I’m sorry, Professor, but I didn’t know
you wanted me to keep the answer on my slate. I rubbed it out.’
For then, he thought, he had shown he knew something by writing on
his slate—even though he did not write the answer at all, but simply
something quite absurd.</p>

<p>“One night he was very tired. He had been playing hard and had
quite forgotten about his lessons. He had also knocked down a little
creature smaller than himself, but he had said to himself that he was
sorry for that. He really hadn’t meant to be so rough.</p>

<p>“Suddenly before his eyes he saw Professor Gnome, only he looked
much bigger than he did in school. He was carrying a big slate.</p>

<p>“‘This is a slate which cannot be rubbed off by your sponge, little
gnome,’ he said. ‘I have the magic rubber for it which the Fairy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
Queen gave me. You can now do your lessons correctly on this slate
and when I think they are well done then I shall take your slate
and rub it clean.’</p>

<p>“And the little gnome seemed to be back in the school-room now
and he had written something on his slate—just to pretend he
knew the answer—and then he tried to rub it off before Professor
Gnome saw it. But it wouldn’t rub at all. And all the class laughed
at him for knowing absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>“Next it was recess time, and the little gnome he had knocked down
was crying. He had bumped his head as he had fallen, and the bump
kept growing larger and larger until at last his head had gone entirely,
and there was only a big bump left!</p>

<p>“Oh, how the gnome felt. ‘I shall always remember that I can’t
rub out everything I do,’ he said. ‘My magic slate will teach me a
good lesson, for I’ll be so ashamed when I see all my mistakes right
in front of me until I have made them really and truly right.’</p>

<p>“It was only a dream, to be sure,” said Witty Witch, “but from
that day on the gnome worked and played as though everything he
did and said could not be washed off unless everything was right.”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“There was once,” said daddy, “a little boy named Peter who
had always longed to see the man in the moon. Every
night when there was a full moon he would sit at his window
and look at the funny, jolly face of the old man until he became
so sleepy he would have to go to bed.</p>

<p>“One night he sat watching so long that he fell asleep by the window.
It was not long before he saw the strangest thing. The moon seemed
to be growing larger and larger, and soon it was back of a tree near
his window. He could see quite plainly the jolly old face of his beloved
man in the moon looking jollier and fatter than ever. The old
man grinned from ear to ear at Peter, and in a moment or two he spoke.</p>

<p>“‘Well, Peter, here I am. Now how do you like me?’ And as he
spoke he chuckled and laughed.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, I think you’re wonderful!’ said Peter, with wild enthusiasm
and joy.</p>

<p>“‘So you think I’m wonderful, do you? Ha, ha! Well, that is a
joke! But there certainly isn’t any one else just like me, that’s true
enough. So maybe I’m wonderful because I’m so queer. What about
that?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span></p>

<p>“‘Oh, no,’ said Peter, ‘you’re wonderful because you’re so fat and
jolly and because you’re always laughing and seeming to have a good
time.’</p>

<p>“At that, the old man in the moon laughed some more and said:
‘Well, you’re a funny little chap too. All folks don’t think it’s such
a compliment to be fat, but I do. It’s the way I am, you see, and it’s
best to be satisfied with the way you are, isn’t it? If you really like
me then I’ll take you off in my chariot of mist to visit the stars, and
you’ll call on all the bright queens of the stars, who sparkle so you can
see them from down on the earth.’</p>

<p>“So off went Peter with the man in the moon for the most gorgeous
trip. They visited all the stars, saw the bright fairy queens who live
in them and all the little elves and brownies. And then the man in the
moon showed Peter where he stayed in the sky and how he moved
every week so that all the little boys and girls in the world could see a
full moon every month. And Peter could see down below all the wee
little houses (they looked so small from where Peter was) and the
earth, which looked very funny and small, too, from up in the moon.
Peter felt a little afraid at first that he’d fall, but as he’d never heard of
the man in the moon having a tumble to earth he felt comforted.
Alas, all too soon the journey had to end, for Peter heard the distant
sound of a breakfast bell.</p>

<p>“As he yawned he realized he’d been sleeping all night by the window.
But, oh, such a gorgeous sleep as it had been!”</p>

when young, and then she had been captured and had been tamed and
had been very friendly with her owner, and after that she was brought
over to this country and given to a Zoo in a large city.</p>

<p>“‘I don’t expect to stay here very long,’ said Dinah. ‘I do not care
about living to a great old age, as some creatures do, and I do not
like captivity. I am different from the ourang-utan and the chimpanzee,
who are so friendly with the keeper.</p>

creatures who are always happy, and if they aren’t always happy, they
are happy most of the time. So look at me while you can. Now is

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day324">NOVEMBER 19: Toody Ruggles’ Luck</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“A number of rich ladies,” began daddy, “at the seashore one
day last summer had been throwing pennies from a bridge
into the water for a lot of poor boys who were diving for
them. The water was quite a good deal over their heads, but the little
boys were marvelous divers and swimmers, having always lived by the
water. The ladies kept on throwing pennies time and time again to
see the wonderful dives the little boys were able to make. They would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
dive straight down into the water and stay down ever so long and then
come up, each one holding a glittering bright penny.</p>

<p>“But, alas, a dreadful thing happened. One of the ladies in throwing
pennies dropped a most beautiful diamond ring off from her finger and
into the deep water.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, dear,’ she cried in dismay, ‘that was the ring I valued most
and cared more for than any piece of jewelry I had. I shouldn’t have
worn it, though, for it was much too loose for that finger. Whatever
shall I do without it? I was so fond, so fond of it!’</p>

<p>“At once the little boys offered to dive for it, for it had been by the
throwing of pennies to them that the lady had lost her much prized
ring, and they wanted, of course, to get it back for her.</p>

<p>“So again and again they dived, but as none of them had seen her
drop it they couldn’t judge where it had been dropped.</p>

<p>“Now, Toody Ruggles was perhaps the best little diver of all, and
yet even he had been so far unsuccessful, but at last he thought he saw
it shining down among some weeds. The lady, however, had just about
given up hopes of ever seeing her ring again when, lo and behold, up
came Toody, his wet little face wreathed in smiles, carrying the beautiful
ring. The lady was overpowered with joy and gave Toody a most
wonderful reward.</p>

<p>“Oh, how happy Toody Ruggles was! At home he had one little
sister who was very fragile and delicate. As their parents had both
died, Toody was trying his best to look after his sister and himself by
selling newspapers and carrying suitcases from the station. Lately,
though, the doctor had told him that his sister must have plenty of
fruit to build her up and to make her regain her strength, and this
poor Toody was unable to afford.</p>

<p>“But now he had the wonderful reward from the lady, and all the
other boys were delighted that Toody had been the lucky one.</p>

<p>“Toody at once began to give his little sister delicious fruits. Soon
the color came back to her cheeks, and she grew well and strong. So
Toody’s worry that he might lose his beloved little sister was over, and
through his good luck their little home once more became very, very
happy.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day325">NOVEMBER 20: The Limpets</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“A limpet,” said daddy, “is a little shellfish. They’re very,
very small, perhaps a shade smaller than a snail, and they
cling to the rocks which are their homes. There are always
hundreds of them fastened on the big rocks on the coast by the sea.
They live on seaweed and the salt water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span></p>

<p>“When I was a boy we spent some time in a town by the sea. We
used to play off a bank called ‘Greenbank’ because in the summer time
this bank was always so very green. Below this bank there were
countless big rocks. We could hide behind these rocks, and no one
could see us. We loved that because it seemed so mysterious to hide
like that. We could see the bank above us, and then, miles and miles,
as far as we could see, was the ocean. The rocks were covered with
seaweed, and they used to be very slippery. Sometimes we would play
hide-and-seek back of these rocks.</p>

<p>“The rocks that were half in the water would be covered with the
limpets. One big rock had great numbers of them on it, and we always
called the rock ‘Limpet Rock.’</p>

<p>“One Saturday about six of us had taken a big basketful of lunch
and had gone down to Greenbank to spend the day. There had been
a terrific storm the night before. We looked for our Limpet Rock the
first thing, but we saw not a sign of a limpet. How funny, we thought;
that surely is the rock! What could have become of the limpets?
They were quite used to storms, and surely they couldn’t have been
hurt by the storm of the night before! Suddenly we spied them.</p>

<p>“There they all were, looking very unhappy and clinging to little
pebbles and rocks in the low water. Before the day was over, though,
the limpets had attached themselves to another big rock. So we called
this rock the ‘New Limpet Rock.’ Once the limpets had fastened themselves
to the new rock, they were just as happy as before, for they
can change homes more easily than any other creatures and be happy.</p>

<p>“So I think we should admire the limpets because they are so brave
and cheerful when they are driven from one home and with practically
no fuss they set about and get a new home right away.”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“A little girl named Fannie,” began daddy, “was walking
across a city street carrying a very small black poodle dog
in her arms.</p>

<p>“Suddenly the poodle dog, whose name was Gyp, saw another dog
on the other side of the street. Evidently Gyp thought the other little
dog would be nice to talk to, so he jumped with one bound out of
Fannie’s arms.</p>

<p>“Fannie gave a scream of horror, at which the policeman, standing
near, flew to the rescue. Had he been a minute later the little dog
would have been struck by a street car.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, you’ve rescued my little dog!’ Fannie cried. ‘You are so
brave and wonderful!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span></p>

<p>“Gyp, who had been very much frightened at his narrow escape, was
breathing little short, quick breaths from the fear of a moment before.</p>

<p>“But at the same time his little tail was wagging for all it was worth,
as he wanted to show the big policeman how much he thanked him,
for he knew the policeman had saved his little dog life.”</p>

<p class="dropcap">“A little boy named Bobbie had a sister named Agnes,” said
daddy. “They had few neighbors, as they lived in a very
small place where there were only a few houses. Near their
house were long stretches of woods. They had never been to the other
side of the woods nor had they ever really walked very far into the
forest, for it was said in the little hamlet where they lived that a queer
old man had a hut about a mile and a half through the long lonely
road. But one day the children decided they’d venture forth to see
this old man.</p>

<p>“Off they started, and after walking quite a distance they came to a
funny little hut with smoke coming out of the chimney. When the old
man saw Bobbie and Agnes he called out in a happy, excited voice:
‘I’m having visitors! Hurrah!’</p>

<p>“He took the children in his hut and showed them some wonderful
picture books. He told them how delighted he was to have visitors,
as he knew he was thought queer, but really he wasn’t at all, except
that he loved to live in the heart of the woods. So the children promised
to see him often, and he promised to show them more picture
books, and before they left he gave them each a big piece of delicious
apple pie.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day328">NOVEMBER 23: The Queen’s Pin</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“Once when I was a little boy,” began daddy, “I heard an
interesting story that a pin told. Now, you may think that
a pin could not tell such a very good story, but this was an
exceptional pin, belonging to a very grand person.</p>

<p>“‘Having been made into a beautiful crown shaped pin of superb
pearls,’ said the pin, ‘I was put into a show case in a very beautiful
jewelry shop. People would notice me above all other pins in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
case and pick me out as being by far the most beautifully set pin. All
the pearls which belonged to me were very, very lovely ones. But I
was so expensive that people could just look at me and could not afford
to buy me.</p>

<p>“‘The jeweler was so proud of me that he really did not care
whether I was sold or not, for my beauty attracted so much attention
that it was a help to his business. You see, people would ask one
another if they had seen me, and if they hadn’t they would come right
to the shop to look at me. Then, though they didn’t buy me, they
would be sure to buy something else in the shop.</p>

<p>“‘But at last a marvelous carriage drove up before the door. It was
drawn by four horses, and there were two fine coachmen and two very
pompous looking footmen sitting up on top of the fine carriage.</p>

<p>“‘The jeweler was all in a flutter. Never before had he seen such
a wonderful carriage. And out of it stepped a very handsomely dressed
lady with a lady on either side of her, who both guarded her very
carefully.</p>

<p>“‘“The queen—the queen has come to my little shop!” cried the
excited jeweler, and all the other shoppers stood by and made low bows.</p>

<p>“‘But I didn’t bow. I didn’t think a crown need bow.</p>

<p>“‘The queen had heard of me, and she had come to buy me. The
jeweler, with trembling fingers, fastened me in my little blue velvet box,
and off I went, carried by the queen.</p>

<p>“‘When we reached the palace I felt very much at home, for everything
was so beautiful there. I must confess, though, that I did feel
a little nervous that first evening when I was worn by the queen with
so many other exquisite jewels.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, but such times as I did have! The court dinners and balls
and receptions were so dazzling, and I adored them. But, best of all,
I loved the parades and seeing all the crowds of people cheer and
wave their handkerchiefs to the queen. And the bands were so exciting!</p>

<p>“‘But the proudest moment of my life was really when the queen
gave me to a young lady as a token of her appreciation of the lady’s
brave soldier daddy.’”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day330">NOVEMBER 25: Thanksgiving Day</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">It was a holiday and it was Thanksgiving Day. From the moment
Melly got up she felt in a “holiday” spirit, she said. And everything
and every one seemed to feel the same way too.</p>

<p>First she went in quite early in the morning to see her mother who
was sitting up in bed, waiting for her little visitor.</p>

<p>Her mother was wearing a dear little blue jacket and a blue cap and
was looking so pretty.</p>

<p>She had a nice little chat with her mother and then she went back
into her own room to get dressed.</p>

<p>Yes, every one in the house seemed to act and feel as though the day
was a holiday as it most certainly was.</p>

<p>And oh, such a Thanksgiving dinner as they had.</p>

<p>First they had corn soup and then they had turkey and many vegetables
and then they had apple and celery salad. Next they had two
pies to choose from, or to take a piece from each, and they had ice-cream
too, and every kind of a nut and piece of fruit was in the fruit
dish.</p>

<p>In the center of the table was a little bit of a pumpkin. It was a real
pumpkin but it was very, very small.</p>

<p>On top of the pumpkin Melly’s mother had put some tiny carrots and
baby potatoes and some little snowberries from the snowberry bush.</p>

<p>They did make the table look so gay and pretty. After dinner Melly
and her family played the good old game of “stagecoach.” You know
the game?</p>

<p>The different people in the room who are playing the game take the
names of the people supposed to be in the stagecoach, such as the
driver, the little boy traveler and his mother and so on.</p>

<p>Every time the word stage-coach is mentioned each person playing the
game must get up and turn around and the last person who sits down
when doing this goes on with the story-telling.</p>

<p>Of course the one who is telling the story must tell all of the trip
this imaginary stage-coach took.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span></p>

<p>And of course the names of all the characters must be mentioned often,
for every time a character is mentioned that one who is taking the part
of the character must get up and turn around.</p>

<p>So Melly and her family played this in the afternoon.</p>

<p>And when it became dark they lighted the lights and the fire was poked
up so that it blazed most beautifully.</p>

<p>They had supper in front of the fire and though each one had said
he couldn’t possibly eat another thing after such a dinner, they all
managed to eat something.</p>

<p>And when Melly went to bed that night she said: “I believe in
Thanksgiving Day! And I have so much to be so thankful for!
More, I’m sure, than anybody else has.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day331">NOVEMBER 26: Thanksgiving Day</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“In 1620 as we all well know,” said daddy, “a ‘little band of Pilgrims’
came to this country, brave, fearless souls who had already
met with difficulties and were not afraid to face more.
They had already tried to cross the Atlantic but their ships had leaked
and they had had to go back.</p>

<p>“But they would have nothing to do with such a word as failure—and
this is I think in itself an inspiration to all of us when we feel
discouraged and as though we were failing in what we were trying to
do—and so at last the Mayflower left Plymouth in Devonshire, England,
and anchored on the American coast on November twenty-first.</p>

<p>“Here they were going to have freedom, and though the trip had
been a terrible one and though there were only a hundred of them
all told to keep up each other’s spirits, they did not lose heart.</p>

<p>“They had planned to land on the New Jersey coast, but driven as
they had been by gales and storms they found themselves on the
Northern shore of Cape Cod, New England. Finally they chose
Plymouth for their colony. Then came a terrible winter when over
half of their number died, but in the spring those who had lived
through the winter still would not use the word failure—and decided
to stay on.</p>

<p>“And then, at last, came harvest time, and hope and great thankfulness
was in the hearts of these people. So that in the autumn
in 1621 they set aside a day in which they gave ‘solemn Thanksgiving
to the glorious Hearer of Prayers!’</p>

<p>“The first national celebration of Thanksgiving was in 1789 when
George Washington named Thursday, November 26th of that year, as
a day to be observed in which to give thanks for the blessings of the
year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span></p>

<p>“It was Abraham Lincoln who recommended that the last Thursday
in November should be observed as a day of Thanksgiving.</p>

<p>“And ever since then it has been observed each year all over the
country, and not from time to time in the different states according to
whether their governors proclaimed it as such. Formerly that had
been the custom.</p>

<p>“So it was Lincoln who gave us this day as a National holiday and
day of Thanksgiving for every year. But it was because of that little
group of people so many years ago that we have so much for which to
be thankful.</p>

<p>“Sometimes it is hard to think that such terrible days followed one
after the other, for the country is so big and prosperous and cultivated
now. But everything has to be begun. And it seems to me that our
present-day joyous Thanksgivings are just what those people, so full
of pluck, would have wanted us to have. For people who could be
so brave and who could endure so much for what they believed was
right, could not help but have hearts full of love and capable of
great happiness.”</p>

they brought some of them to a zoo and people learned of their ways

left quite free. Surely that is good news for buffaloes.”</p>

<p class="dropcap">“A very rich and spoiled little girl,” said daddy, “owned
a gun-metal wrist watch. It kept very bad time, and she
had it mended again and again.</p>

<p>“One day she went and had it fixed for the very last time, she said,
and several days afterward the watch would not go for more than a half
hour at a time. She took it back to the watch mender and was told that
the only thing that could be done would be to have new works put in it.
She said the watch wasn’t worth that and she was so annoyed that she
threw the watch into the first ash can she saw.</p>

<p>“Well, there passed by a very poor little girl. On top of the ash can
she spied a paper with funny pictures, and she grabbed the paper out
of the ash can, and then, to her amazement, she saw the little watch.</p>

<p>“She ran all the way home to show it to her daddy, for her daddy had
often mended watches for people just as favors, as his real business was
that of a fruit dealer.</p>

<p>“When her daddy saw it he said:</p>

<p>“‘This watch has been fussed with so much that it is no wonder it refuses
to go. I will see that it goes.’ And sure enough he did.</p>

<p>“The watch went beautifully, and the little poor girl wore her gun-metal
watch with the greatest pride.</p>

<p>“Every one had to ask her the time, of course, every few minutes so
she could look at her watch, and if they didn’t ask her the time often
enough she would tell them of her own accord.</p>

<p>“Now, the little rich girl was given a gold watch as a present from
her daddy, but it didn’t give half the pleasure that the little gun-metal
watch gave the little girl whose very own daddy mended the watch for
her.”</p>

For the Fire Witches tell bedtime tales. Soon the Fairies will be sound,
sound asleep. They love to be put to sleep by the Fire Witches.”</p>

but they will first whisper a ‘Thank you’ to the Witches who tell the
marvelous stories.” And just as daddy said that, the children heard a
faint, crackling noise, and then they knew that every creature of the
Fireplace had gone to sleep in their warm ashes of pleasant dreams.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day338">DECEMBER 3: The Pig Who Had No Table Manners</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“I have a fairy tale to tell you this evening,” said daddy, “of a
little pig who left his mother to visit the fox family.</p>

<p>“The foxes, as you know, are very careful about their table
manners and also extremely proud and were quite disgusted with little
Piggy Look-a-do’s table manners, for instead of saying ‘Thank you,’ he’d
just grunt when anything was passed to him. He swallowed his food
without chewing it at all. He would reach across the table, and if he
couldn’t reach a thing he’d climb on the table, much to the horror of
all the other animals. Well, in fact, he behaved so badly that all his
other nice mannered playmates simply would not have anything to do
with him and just called him ‘pig.’</p>

<p>“Even Br’er B’ar couldn’t like him because of his bad manners, and
finally he just had to go out and root in the ground for something to
eat. Of course when he did that he ruined his lovely little clothes, his
white shoes and trousers became all muddy, and his little speckled coat
got very rusty looking.</p>

<p>“Piggy Look-a-do realized that he was losing his good looks, for the
little pink nose looked white and his eyes very dull. He was too proud
to return home to his mother, so he wandered through the woods trying
to find something to eat. Finally he came to an apple orchard belonging
to a mountaineer. This was the end of poor Piggy Look-a-do, for
the next day he was killed and came on the table, roasted nice and
brown, with a big red apple in his mouth, and made a fine feast for the
old mountaineer and his family.”</p>

<p>“Well, Jimmie wrote a letter to Santa Claus not long ago,
and he wrote the following:</p>

<p>“‘Please, dear Santa Claus, give me a little toy airplane. For when
I’m a big man I want to go up in the air in a real one! I’d love to fly
and so I’d like a little airplane which would fly around the room as
I’ve seen them do in the store. The store at the second corner after you
pass my house has one. It looks like a nice one, too.</p>

<p>“‘Wishing you a Merry Christmas, your loving friend Jimmie.’ And
Santa has reserved the airplane for his little friend Jimmie, I’ve heard,”
concluded daddy.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“‘Dear Santa Claus: I would like a rag doll and a doll
which says Mamma and Papa, and can shut her eyes. I also want a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
book and a set of paints, and please, dear Santa, bring my mother and
daddy a doggie to guard the house. I want a doggie too, but mother
and daddy also want one, so we could all share one doggie.</p>

<p>“‘Your affectionate little friend,</p>

<p>“‘P. S.—Please give my love to your Reindeer and a great deal of
love for you, dear Santa Claus.</p>

<p class="right">“‘PEGGY.’</p>

</div>

<p>“She put her letter down by the fireplace and the next morning it
was gone, for she had addressed it quite correctly to ‘Mr. Santa Claus,
By the Fireplace.’ As he was on the lookout for letters such as these
around Christmas time, of course, he got it safely.</p>

<p>“Now Santa Claus loves to get letters. His mail around Christmas
time is tremendous. But the more he gets, the more he chuckles and
laughs to himself. ‘Oh this is splendid,’ he says, as he opens letter
after letter. Days went by and Peggy kept wondering what Santa
Claus would bring her for Christmas. She thought of writing him
again about the doggie, for her mother and daddy would say so often:</p>

<p>“‘It would be a great protection if we only had a dog. This house
is rather far away from the rest, and then we would be safe. Besides,
a dog is such a companionable animal and the children would love him.’</p>

<p>“Somehow, she didn’t like to write again to Santa Claus, but just before
bedtime each night, she would whisper up the chimney—‘Please,
dear Santa Claus, don’t forget the doggie—and the doll, and the paint
box—and—and,’ but by this time her mother had led her off, for she
would have gone on talking and talking to Santa Claus. And if she
had kept on talking and missing her sleep, she would have been too
tired to enjoy Christmas Day when it came.</p>

<p>“At last it was Christmas Eve. Again Peggy called up the chimney,
and she put her stocking first on one side and then the other. And
by her stocking hung four smaller ones, for Peggy’s little sisters and
brothers.</p>

<p>“‘Good night, Santa Claus, Merry Christmas. My love to the
Reindeer,’ called Peggy for the last time. And the younger children
called out too, ‘Good night, Santa Claus, give our love to the Reindeer.’</p>

<p>“And off they all trotted to the land of dreams which they had to
pass through before Christmas morning would come.</p>

<p>“The next morning, bright and early, Peggy and her sisters and
brothers were up looking at their stockings. Such goodies as they
found! Peggy got her rag doll, and a doll who could shut her eyes,
and say ‘Mamma, Papa.’ And she got a set of paints and a fine book.</p>

<p>“Her sisters and brothers got the presents they had asked for, and
they had such fun over the oranges in their stockings. Several of them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
were covered with black soot which Santa had dropped coming down
the chimney! They loved to think of how Santa Claus had picked
out these very oranges himself.</p>

<p>“But when the first excitement was over, Peggy thought to herself,
‘There is no doggie.’ But then she thought Santa Claus was not supposed
to get her everything she asked for. So after brushing away
a tear which had fallen she began to laugh and play and say, ‘Merry
Christmas,’ over and over and over again, to her mother and daddy,
her sisters and brothers. But in a moment or two they all thought
they heard a whimper outside the front door. ‘I shall see what can be
outside,’ said Peggy, with beating heart. She opened the door! And
there stood a little white dog, shivering miserably in the cold. ‘I have
no home,’ the little dog’s eyes seemed to say, and as Peggy held him
closely to her she said, ‘I know Santa Claus sent you here, and I wish
you a Merry Christmas! And this is to be your home, Doggie dear!’”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day341">DECEMBER 6: The Pride of Toys</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“Oh, I’m so proud,” whispered little brown Teddy Bear.</p>

<p>“You’re no more proud than I am,” said a little white
lamb. “Please pinch me—so—and then I will say: ‘Baa-Baa-Baa.’
Ah, that will make some one happy.”</p>

<p>The toys were in Santa Claus’ toy-shop and they were getting very
much excited. There were still some to be finished—in fact, there were
many to be finished, but none of them were worried, for they knew
perfectly well that Santa Claus never left any toys unfinished.</p>

<p>That was the wonderful part of Santa Claus. He could be rushed
and hurried and he could be so busy that you wondered how it was
possible for him to do so much and you might think, if you didn’t
know, that some of those many, many things wouldn’t be done. But
the toys knew, for the tools which Santa used to make them with whispered
to them many secrets.</p>

<p>“He may be busy,” the tools always told the new toys, “but he’ll
finish you and you’ll go to the children on Christmas day.”</p>

<p>“How proud I will be,” whispered the Teddy Bear once more, “if
I am put on a tree. They say that Santa hangs toys on Christmas
trees. But then I would be just as proud if I were put in a stocking.
How I would love to peep my head out from the top of a stocking
and see the children as they come downstairs early Christmas morning!
In fact, I would be proud no matter where Santa put me, or how he
gave me. It’s a great big and wonderful pride to be a toy made by
Santa Claus which is given to a child on Christmas day.”</p>

<p>“That is what we all feel,” said the other toys.</p>

daddy, “meet near the largest tree, which they pick out for
the occasion. Then there is a wild scramble up the tree
for the branches, where the squirrels perch themselves, and finally the
feast begins.</p>

<p>“After they have finished their scrumptious Christmas dinner they
play ‘tag,’ ‘hide-and-seek’ and many other games, which make the
branches wave around as they jump from one tree to the other. Prizes
are offered by the older squirrels for the sports and games which are
played. The prizes are usually extraordinarily big nuts or very red
apples. Sometimes, too, kind children just before Christmas put nuts
in the trees where the squirrels can find them. That makes the
squirrels very happy, and they call these nuts their Christmas gifts.”</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day344">DECEMBER 9: A Letter to Santa Claus and the Answer</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“I saw such a poor little boy to-day,” began daddy to Jack and
Evelyn. “He was looking in a shop window where there were
loads of toys, and as he looked great, huge tears dropped from
his eyes and trickled down his face.</p>

<p>“I spoke to him and asked him where he lived, and for a moment he
couldn’t speak, but between sobs he began to tell me of his life. He
was very ragged and quite dirty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span></p>

<p>“He told me his daddy had died in the summer and that a few
months afterward his mother had married a horrid, cruel man who
hated him and called him ‘little nuisance.’ The stepfather didn’t like
to work, and as soon as he had used up his wife’s savings he told the
little boy he would have to beg or steal his food, for he wouldn’t be
bothered with him.</p>

<p>“The little boy said that he had always had a happy home, a good
warm fire and plenty to eat when he came home from school, and he
simply would not beg or steal. One night he came home, of course
bringing nothing. His stepfather saw he could neither make him beg
nor steal so he forced him to leave the house. His mother was so
afraid of his stepfather that she did not say a word. Now, he had been
away from home for two weeks. He spent his nights with a little school
friend, but he could not stay there much longer, as the boy’s parents
were so poor they could hardly keep their children. He dreaded the
cold, but what he felt more than anything was that Santa Claus did not
know where he was and that he would have no Christmas.”</p>

<p>“Let’s write Santa a letter right away,” said Evelyn, “and tell him
about the little boy. What’s his name, daddy?”</p>

<p>“His name is Harry Armstrong, and tell Santa to bring his presents
here, for I’ve told him he can do odd chores for us and stay here for
a while.”</p>

<p>So Evelyn wrote: “Dear Santa—A poor little boy named Harry
Armstrong is afraid he’ll have no Christmas. So please, dear Santa,
send him a warm suit, an overcoat, a sled, some skates and lots of
candy. Your loving Evelyn.”</p>

<p>Jack and Evelyn had just gone to bed when daddy walked into
their room with a note and a stamp of soot on it. Evelyn hurriedly
opened it and read aloud: “Dear Evelyn—I won’t forget about
Harry Armstrong on Christmas, and you were very dear to think
of some one else who wanted a Christmas. Your friend, Santa Claus.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” shouted Jack and Evelyn together.</p>

him a very handsome high one.</p>

<p>“‘To be sure,’ said Peter Gnome. ‘A snow man isn’t a real snow
man without a pipe. We’ll make it right away.’</p>

<p>“So they got some twigs and some wood, and with their little pen
knives they all made pipes. The very best pipe of all was chosen
for the snow man, while the other pipes they put around on the ground
beside him.</p>

<p>“‘For,’ said Peter Gnome, ‘he ought to have a little collection of
pipes.’</p>

<p>“He was the tallest snow man ever made and he looked so jolly
and happy. He reached so far up that when it grew dark Mr. Moon
came out and said:</p>

<p>“‘What is it I see? A man who is almost tall enough to talk to
me. What fun!’</p>

<p>Sharpy and Chappy looked their very best, or tried to, standing
on their hind legs and looking very sweet and cunning as they begged.

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day348">DECEMBER 13: Christmas Letters</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“Still the letters keep coming,” chuckled Santa Claus. “And
every year it seems to me as though I received a larger mail
than I ever had before.</p>

<p>“But it can never be too large for Santa Claus.</p>

<p>“And the precious dears! What memories they have. They
know just what they want! They don’t forget!</p>

<p>“They think old Santa remembers too when they have told him
one thing and then just add a little postscript or another letter without
explaining to him just what their last letter was about.</p>

<p>“They think he can remember and keep them all straight, even
though he may get several letters from the same child in many, many
cases.</p>

<p>“They think he can remember their names from year to year, and
they’re right. Yes, the blessed little dears are right.” And Santa
Claus chuckled to himself as he stroked his beard and by the burning
coals of the great stove in his workshop he read the letters which
had just come.</p>

<p>“Dear Santa Claus,” was the beginning of every one, or at least
almost every one, though some of them began, “Dear, dear Santa
Claus,” and “You precious old Santa Claus,” and a number of other
nice beginnings like that, which made Santa Claus very happy.</p>

<p>But every letter made him happy, for every letter was just a little
different and he liked all the children to be different and not to be
just alike.</p>

<p>“I hope you remember me,” one read, “for I wrote to you last
year and the year before. The year before that I was too young<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
to write, but my brudder wrote for me? Do you remember my brudder’s
letter that he wrote that year? He said that he guessed the
next year I could write you a letter, for I could then write my name.</p>

<p>“And my brudder was right and the next year I did write you a
letter.”</p>

<p>Some of the spelling wasn’t just like this, but this is the way it
sounded as Santa Claus read it aloud. He was all by himself, except
that his collie dog, Boy of the North, was sitting by him on the floor,
but he read it aloud, for he loved to hear the sound of the words
the children had written and picture them as they looked while writing.</p>

<p>And he didn’t care about the spelling.</p>

<p>“Of course,” he said to himself, “they must go to school and learn
how to spell, for they would feel dreadfully when they grew up if
they didn’t know more than they do now!</p>

<p>“But when they’re writing to Santa Claus it doesn’t make so much
difference. They can take a little holiday then. And even when
they make a blot and then write down by it that it is a kiss I know
that they do mean to send a kiss to me, even if the blot itself was
accidental!</p>

<p>“Well, I must go on with this letter.”</p>

<p>He went on with the letter and this was what he read:</p>

<p>“My brudder won a gold medal in school the other day. He is
getting to be so smart, dear Santa, and I know you’ll be pleased
to hear it. You sent me a picture once Santa when I was very little
of a boy who was very cold on his way to school with his coat all
wrapped up tight around him.</p>

<p>“In school he won the gold medal. It was the day they gave
the prizes, and coming home from school the picture showed the boy
with his coat open wide, and the gold medal pinned on, and he didn’t
feel the cold the least bit!</p>

<p>“Do you ’member, Santa Claus? Brudder was like that the other
day.”</p>

<p>Yes, he remembered that picture and how pleased he was to think
the boy, a boy he had always liked so much, had won a gold medal.</p>

<p>And on he read the letters. Some were letters just full of news
of what they all were doing in the different homes, of what they were
going to do, and in some they wrote of the new sisters or brothers
who had come since Santa Claus had last been written to.</p>

<p>Of course they told him what presents they wanted and they all
said they hoped he wouldn’t get too tired, and they all, every single
one of them, told him how they loved him and wished him a Merry
Christmas, too.</p>

<p>And that made Santa Claus so very, very happy.</p>

three little girls, and oh, Boy of the North, they were such nice little
girls!</p>

<p>“They were really lovely, and so good! Of course they were asleep,
but no matter, Boy of the North, you needn’t laugh; they were good children
I can tell you. Even if mothers and daddies may say children are
bad at times I only say, ‘Well, what child isn’t bad sometimes?’ It
wouldn’t upset old Santa for he knows they’re doing their best and trying
their best.</p>

<p>“But, as I said, these children were such nice little girls.</p>

<p>“They were asleep, as I told you, when I saw them. They slept in
three little white beds and each had her hair in two beautiful braids.</p>

<p>“I filled their stockings and I said to myself, ‘You are a nice collection
of youngsters for any mother and any father to be proud of! Dear me!
But I’m proud to be old Santa Claus and to have the honor of filling
your Christmas stockings.’</p>

<p>“Then I went downstairs where there was a tree and I started
a-trimming of the tree. They had left some things for me to use.
Some people are kind that way about leaving many of the nice decorations
which can be used every Christmas. It saves me room in my pack
and I like to see the same old decorations coming out year after year.</p>

<p>“But I saw something else there, too. I saw a present, a gift for
me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span></p>

<p>“I looked down at it, and saw that it was addressed to me and that
it said, ‘To Santa Claus, with love from Helen.’ And I saw that it
had another little note inside which said, ‘Dear Santa, I made this
myself, so please forgive mistakes.’</p>

<p>“It was a pincushion, Boy of the North, and I have it in my room
now. You may have noticed it.”</p>

<p>Boy of the North wagged his tail.</p>

<p>“Well, I was pleased and I wrote Helen a note thanking her, but
really, Boy of the North, I mean this quite truly, I don’t care about
getting presents. I like to feel I’m one person who gives gifts but who
doesn’t receive gifts, for I have all my thanks in the smiles of children.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="day352">DECEMBER 17: Santa Claus and Teddy</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“One year Santa was very, very busy, and so he sent a note
to the mothers and fathers in a certain town telling them
that he was so rushed he would have to leave his presents
some time before Christmas, and that he would, of course, stop off a
little while Christmas Eve to fill all the stockings and trim the trees.</p>

<p>“In one house lived a little boy named Teddy. His daddy told him
that Santa had left some of his presents ahead of time, but that he had
especially said that he did not wish the little boy to look in any of the
closets and put him on his honor not to, for if he should look Santa had
said he would take away the presents.</p>

<p>“The little boy had asked Santa Claus for a horse and cart, which he
wanted more than anything in the world.</p>

<p>“Several days went by, and the little boy resisted the temptation of
looking to see if the horse and cart had come. But one day he could
stand it no longer, so when every one was out he looked into all the
closets, and in the last one he saw the long wished for horse and cart.
Such a beauty as it was too! The horse had a mane and a tail of real<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
hair, and the cart was painted a bright red. Oh, how delighted the
little boy was, and he closed the closet door and went back to his play-room
very happy.</p>

<p>“As no one had seen him look into the closet, the next day he thought
he would take another look. What was his horror to find that the
horse and cart had disappeared, and no sign of it was anywhere to be
found. He cried himself to sleep, so ashamed did he feel.</p>

<p>“The next morning he decided to write to Santa Claus. So he said,</p>

<p>“‘Dear Santa Claus—I know I was a naughty boy and looked when
I was told not to. Please forgive me and give me back the horse and
cart and I will never be a bad boy again.’</p>

<p>“He put this note up the chimney, and the very next morning he
found this lovely answer:</p>

<p>“‘Dear Teddy—I am sure you are sorry, and am certain you will
never do such a thing again. So on Christmas morning when you get
up you will find the horse and cart awaiting you. Your old friend,
Santa Claus.’”</p>

<p class="dropcap">“Where are you going—all dressed up?” asked the Blue
Sky of Mr. Sun.</p>

<p>“I am going to a coasting party,” he said.</p>

<p>“And pray tell me, how can you go to a coasting party?” asked the
Blue Sky as a smile in the shape of a little silver cloud came over it.</p>

<p>“And why not?” asked Mr. Sun.</p>

<p>“I’d hardly say,” continued the Blue Sky, “that coasting was exactly
one of your talents. No, not exactly. Now confess! You can’t coast.
So why do you go to a coasting party? It would be as funny as if the
Blue Sky went a-skating.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but don’t you see?” said Mr. Sun.</p>

<p>“Just because you’re so extremely bright there is no reason why you
need think you’re the only one who sees. I can see perfectly, thank you,
and on a clear day like this I’m at my best.”</p>

<p>“But you don’t see—truly—” persisted Mr. Sun.</p>

<p>“Then explain to me how you can go to a coasting party,” said the
Blue Sky.</p>

<p>“There! That’s something like! Now that you’ve asked me the
necessary question I can tell you my story.”</p>

<p>“Must you always have the necessary question, Mr. Sun?”</p>

<p>“Always,” replied Mr. Sun.</p>

<p>“Well continue,” said the Blue Sky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span></p>

<p>“It’s this way,” said Mr. Sun. “You see there are many children
in the world.”</p>

<p>“That isn’t news to me, Mr. Sun.”</p>

<p>“I’m only telling it to you to begin with.”</p>

<p>“Begin with something I don’t know,” said the Blue Sky.</p>

<p>“How do you suppose I can tell just what you know and what you
don’t? I never went to your school.”</p>

<p>“Oh well,” said the Blue Sky frowning a little, while three small
clouds came over it, “go on with your story any way you please.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Mr. Sun. “Some of these children are giving a
coasting party this afternoon, and what do you suppose they said?”</p>

<p>“I’ve no idea,” said the Blue Sky. “I don’t see how any one could
guess. Children are apt to say so many different things. They seem
to know so many words and games and stories and all sorts of things.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mr. Sun, “they’re bright little things, that’s true.”</p>

<p>“You talk about them, Mr. Sun, as if they were Stars. Bright little
things indeed! How funny you are!”</p>

<p>“Well they are little and they are bright, aren’t they?”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the Blue Sky. “Do go on with your story.”</p>

<p>“I don’t get half a chance,” said Mr. Sun looking a little dull for a
moment.</p>

<p>“I won’t say another word,” said the Blue Sky.</p>

<p>“And these children said, ‘We do hope Mr. Sun will come to our
coasting party.’ Now then! I was asked to come by the children.
A great honor—and I’m going. Yes, I’m going to shine with might
and main over that party. They’ll keep so warm! They’ll have such
a good time, and they’ll be so glad that they asked me!”</p>

<p>“I don’t think it’s such an honor,” said the Blue Sky, “for they’re
just making use of you.”</p>

<p>“I like to be useful,” said Mr. Sun.</p>

<p>Now just at that moment the children appeared for their coasting
party. “Oh see the bright Sun,” they exclaimed. “We wished for the
Sun and here he is. Such fun as we’ll have now.”</p>

<p>And then one of them added, “And the Sky is all blue—it’s a wonderful
day!”</p>

<p>“Run away, Clouds,” said the Blue Sky. “These children like me
too.”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha, ha,” laughed Mr. Sun. “So you will do as the children
ask, eh?” And the whole big face of the Blue Sky was without a cloud
or a frown!</p>

<p>And the children had a Blue Sky and the Sun for their party.</p>

could make those sounds.”</p>

“The little Eskimaux who live so far up north had been too
excited to sleep.</p>

<p>“Finally one of the daddy Eskimaux said: ‘I’m afraid something
must have happened to Santa Claus. The storm last night was so
wild. Let’s get some of the dogs and sleds.’ So a number of the bigger
boys and some of the men began to get ready. They bundled up
so much that all you could see was their eyes. The storm had let up,
but the snowdrifts were like mountains. They had just started when
a tinkling of bells was heard, and what should they see but eight beautiful
reindeer and old Santa Claus dressed in a red suit with great big
furs. On his back was a huge bag which was almost overflowing, so
full was it.</p>

<p>“‘Merry Christmas, Santa Claus!’ shrieked all the little Eskimaux.</p>

<p>“‘Merry Christmas to you all!’ said Santa, and the reindeer shook
their heads and tinkled their bells, which was their way of saying ‘Merry
Christmas.’</p>

<p>“Poor Santa’s mustache and eyebrows were frozen, and his face was
very, very red from the cold. But, oh, it was so jolly for them
actually to have Santa with them! They had never before been awake
when he had come even though his visit to them was always his last.</p>

<p>“As soon as he had warmed his hands and had seen to the feeding of
his reindeer and patted them for their bravery he undid his pack. And
such a Christmas as they all did have!</p>

<p>“‘You know,’ said Santa, ‘I’m glad there was such a storm, for this
is my very first Christmas party!’”</p>

me all ready.</p>

<p>“I know Santa Claus will give me the most beautiful of decorations,
for I’ve often heard my family talk of the wonderful Christmas trees
there have been. Ah, how handsome many of my relations have looked,
and I can hardly wait until Santa Claus comes to see me.”</p>

<p>“You’re not any more excited than we are,” said three stockings
which hung up by the side of the mantel-piece.</p>

<p>“I belong to Dot, age four,” said the white stocking.</p>

<p>“I am hanging up for Jimmie, age eight,” said the tan stocking.</p>

<p>“And I am for Betty, age six,” said the black stocking.</p>

<p>“I’m for all of them,” said the Christmas tree.</p>

<p>“That’s so,” agreed the stockings. “But even if we’re not for all of
them, but each stocking for one child, we’re just as excited as we can
be.”</p>

<p>“Have you ever been here before?” asked the tree.</p>

<p>“Yes, we’re used every Christmas. We’re kept just for Christmas.
That’s all we do all the year. We’re put up the night before,
on Christmas Eve, and down we come on Christmas morning, but between
then and Christmas morning the most wonderful things happen!
Ah!” and the stockings waved a little as they talked of their evening
and morning of pleasure.</p>

<p>“It’s far better than being around all the time and getting worn out.
We’re very fortunate stockings!”</p>

<p>“You are indeed,” said the Christmas tree. “But for my part I am
willing to be around for one season of the year and to have a glorious
time then. Oh dear, I am so excited! I can hardly wait!”</p>

<p>“Patience, dear tree,” said the stockings. “Santa Claus will soon
be here.”</p>

<p>“You don’t think he will lose his way,” said the tree. “I never heard
of his losing his way from any of my relations. But perhaps he might
forget about this house.”</p>

<p>“Santa Claus forget a house where there are children! Dear me,

corners of the rooms that all the little boys and girls in the
world once a year had a Christmas tree full of goodies,” said
daddy. “A dear old person named Santa Claus trimmed the tree for
them and filled the stockings which they hung up by the fireplaces.</p>

<p>“The little mouse didn’t see why he shouldn’t have a Christmas, too,
so he told another little mouse what he had heard. Together they
planned what they would do. They would bore two little holes into
the parlor where they had heard the tree was to be. There they
stayed every night, keeping very quiet. They heard the children talk
about what they hoped Santa Claus would bring them and saw them
constantly send notes up the chimney to him.</p>

the children know they were there, and with a great deal of self
denial they stayed out of the pantry, living for their very own Christmas
party.</p>

<p>“At last Christmas Eve came. They saw the children in their little
nighties hang up their stockings by the fireplace and then trot off to
bed.</p>

<p>“Before long the mice heard strange noises on the roof, and then
a little soot began to fall down the chimney. Soon they saw a jolly
old man appear, with white hair and a white beard, from the chimney,
and they nudged each other, whispering, ‘That must be Santa Claus.’</p>

<p>“Sure enough, it was Santa Claus, for he had a big bag of presents
with him, and at once he set to work. At first he trimmed the tree.
He had plenty of silver trimming and candles; but, best of all (thought
the mice), he strung popcorn over the tree and made it look as if
the snow had fallen over it. Then he tied candy canes and candy
animals of all sorts on the branches. Next he filled the stockings,
and how the mouths of the two little mice did water as they saw all
sorts of nuts, raisins and big rosy-cheeked apples going in! The
toys didn’t interest the mice, as they were longing to get at the things
to eat.</p>

<p>“Before long Santa was through and quickly disappeared up the
chimney. And then—the mice began their feast. And, oh, what a
time they did have! They ate until they could eat no more, and
they thought Christmas the finest time of the year, for never before
had they seen food still before them which they weren’t hungry
for!</p>

<p>“The next morning when the children saw so many nutshells and
bits of popcorn lying around they knew that some little mice must have
had a party, but they didn’t set a trap, as they thought it was fine
that the mice had had a Christmas party too.”</p>

had been hanging in front of the mantelpiece. Every stocking
was well filled. And each stocking stuck out queerly so that no
one could guess what was in it. After the stockings had been looked
at and the oranges and apples had rolled out of the toes, the presents
were taken from the tree. Before long they began to feel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
hungry, for they hadn’t waited to have breakfast first. They ate
Santa’s wonderful oranges, and the children’s mother said to their

does. He’s a better shopper than I am!”</p>

than any other, and he can see through it miles and miles and miles.</p>

<p>“Every Christmas morning he sits at the window at the extreme end
of his toy-shop and looks through the telescope. He sees into the different
homes and he watches the children as they take their presents
and open them, and empty their stockings.</p>

<p>“‘There,’ he said to himself last Christmas, ‘it is just as I thought;
little girls will never grow tired of dolls and boys will always like trains.</p>

<p>“‘And they enjoy a good game, too, for the winter evenings. And,
ah, I see that boy at his skates! He asked for a pair in his letter
to me—that is, he asked for them in six different letters he wrote me.
He really can hardly wait to start using them. I do believe he would
like it if the floor were suddenly covered with ice!</p>

<p>“‘And how that little girl is hugging her doll! I thought the one I
made with the golden curls and the eyes that opened and shut would
just about suit her. She told me the kind she wanted in her letter.
What a help those letters are! They tell me what they want, and they
tell me so many more nice things, too. They tell me how much they
are looking forward to my visit, and that they hope I’ll have a Merry
Christmas, too. The dear little people! As if I could help but have a
Merry Christmas when I look through this telescope and see their smiles!
How happy they do look! How their eyes sparkle.</p>

<p>“‘And if ever I see a child scowl or look cross—oh, dear—how sad it
does make me! There! I just saw a little girl look very cross because
she thinks her brother’s set of soldiers are better than her paper
dolls. Oh, that makes me very unhappy!’</p>

that nice white lamb with the blue ribbon around its neck that I gave
her. And how she does love him. What joy it is to have this telescope!’

it starts up anew, because at the bottom are these ashes. Only I can

‘Now,’ he said to himself, ‘I must think out a way to get

<p>“The people went on building, and they were so interested in watching
the floors grow—one went right on top of the other—that they seemed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
to forget all about Santa Claus and his one trip of the year, which is
worth more than anything else that happens.</p>

<p>“And then the people began to build fire-escapes. For they said
that when the buildings were so large and there were so many rooms and
so many families, they must have a way of getting out in case of fire.
And from top to bottom of every building—on every side—they put fire
escapes, so that no home was without one.</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ said Santa Claus, as he drove his reindeer over the roofs of
the city that night, to see about his Christmas trip, ‘that is something I
like! Now I know what to do!’</p>

<p>“So when Santa Claus goes to the city homes where there are no
chimneys he leaves his reindeer on the roof, and down he goes on the
fire-escape to every single home, and in he gets with his pack. For did
you ever know any place locked up so tightly but that there was a way
for Santa Claus to get in?</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, Santa Claus visits the cities and the villages and the farms.
He just has to do a little differently in some homes than in others.
But it makes no difference to him what they may build, for, after all,
Santa Claus is Santa Claus, and he always makes a way to visit children
every Christmas! For he is the children’s King and he reigns
over Christmas Day—the greatest day of all!”</p>

<p>“‘I’d like to have long hair and have folks think me clever without
having to say a word. I’d like to own a big automobile and I’d like to
act in a show where all I’d have to do would be to smile and folks
would think me grand.’</p>

<p>“‘Well, well,’ said Billie Brownie. ‘Anything else?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ said Jasper, ‘I’d like to make a great deal of money and have
a fine job and not have to work at all.’</p>

<p>“‘In fact,’ said Billie Brownie, ‘you’d like to be famous and rich and
admired without doing a thing yourself! Well, well, Jasper, your
ideas are all mixed up. You haven’t ambitions. You’re just greedy,
I fear. And if I were you, I’d think a while and make a New Year’s
resolution that I’d be good and kind and work hard and make myself
worth while rather than rich. And when you’ve tried what fun it is to
work hard and play hard and be kind, you’ll find how happy you are.
And happiness is greater than fame. Billie Brownie knows!’”</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
